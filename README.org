#+TITLE: Chapter 3 Modularity, Objects, and State
* Assignment and Local State
We now introduce "state" in our programming language at length. By introduction
this concept, we get to model real world system more naturally and modularly
combining with message passing programming.
** Local State Variables
To introduce the local state variable, we need to special expression that can
change the state of variable. More specifically, that expression has to update
value of the state variable. For this, scheme has special syntax called =(set!
<name> <new-value>)=.
*** Exercise 3.1
Using the general scheme that combines local variable with =set!= expression, we
can easily implement what we asked:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-accumulator sum)
  (lambda (num)
    (set! sum (+ sum num))
    sum))
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.2
Let we first specify what the =make-monitored= should satisfy:
- It should use the message passing programming to dispatch on input to
  implement the special symbol input.
- It should have local variable, say count, to count the number of calls of its
  procedure argument =f=; it should use =set!= to change the value of its
  internal state variable.


Then we can encode that specification directly:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-monitored f)
  (let ((count 0))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'how-many-calls?) count)
            ((eq? m 'reset-count) (set! count 0))
            (else
             (set! count (1+ count))
             (f m))))))
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.3
We can do what we should do by slightly amending the procedure defined in text:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-account balance password)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch pd m)
    (if (eq? pd password)
        (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
              ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
              (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                           m)))
        "Incorrect password")))
#+END_SRC

Unfortunately this code doesn't pass the test case =((acc 'some-other-password
'deposit) 50)=, which returns
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;The object "Incorrect password" is not applicable.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 2) => Specify a procedure to use in its place.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC
not what expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
"Incorrect password"
#+END_SRC

We can fix this by using type analysis: we should return procedure not the
primitive data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-account balance password)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch pd m)
    (if (eq? pd password)
        (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
              ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
              (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                           m)))
        (lambda (x) "Incorrect password")))
  dispatch)
#+END_SRC

Then it pass all the test specified in text book.
*** Exercise 3.4
This problem can be solved conjunction with the two previous exercises: 3.2 with 3.3.

To implement what we requested, first let we code the test cases, which encodes
all the specifications it should satisfy:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; Test code
;;; consequetive call case
(define acc (make-account 100 'secret-password))
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"call-the-cops"
;;; reset count
((acc 'secret-password 'withdraw) 40)
60
;;; interposed case
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'secret-password 'withdraw) 40)
20
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"Incorrect password"
((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
"call-the-cops"
#+END_SRC

Then modify the code of exercise 3.3:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-account balance password)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (let ((n-incorrect 0))
    (define (dispatch pd m)
      (if (eq? pd password)
          (begin
            (set! n-incorrect 0)        ;reset the counter
            (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
                  ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
                  (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                               m))))
          (lambda (x)
            (set! n-incorrect (1+ n-incorrect))
            (if (>= n-incorrect 7)
                "call-the-cops"
                "Incorrect password"))))
    dispatch))
#+END_SRC

It passes all the test case.
** The Benefits of Introducing Assignment
In the text book, it explane the benefits of introducing assignment expression
in our language taking Monte Carlo test as example. Without using assignment, we
should handle explicitly the state of each experiment that use random number;
it results into leaking the guts of state over the most higher level of
language: Monte Carlo test. No more general Monte Carlo test, only the specific
instance of that kind.
*** Exercise 3.5
We can implement this exercise directly or we can do using what we learned so
far, data abstraction:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; top level
(define (estimate-integral P rect trials)
  (* (rect 'area)
     (monte-carlo trials
                  (lambda () (P (random-in-rect rect))))))
;; dependency
(define (monte-carlo trials experiment)
  (define (iter trials-remaining trials-passed)
    (cond ((= trials-remaining 0)
           (/ trials-passed trials))
          ((experiment)
           (iter (- trials-remaining 1) (+ trials-passed 1)))
          (else
           (iter (- trials-remaining 1) trials-passed))))
  (iter trials 0))
#+END_SRC
Here we captured the upper and lower bounds as rectangle; also we exploit that
structure in generating random point in that rectangle. In this way, our program
start to self-document what we are trying to do. With this, we can test this
unit by
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; test estimate-integral
(define p1 (make-point -1 -1))
(define p2 (make-point 1 1))
(define r (make-rect p1 p2))
(define (P pt) (<= (+ (square (x-coor pt))
                      (square (y-coor pt)))
                   1))
(estimate-integral P r 100)
;; it should converge to 3.141592...
#+END_SRC
It's true that we can not test this code until implement the lower level
language but it is important to note that we can write the unit test.

Then we can implement the other levels of language:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; middle level
(define (random-in-rect rect)
  (let ((points (list (bottom-left rect) (top-right rect))))
    (make-point (random-in-range
                 (map exact->inexact (map x-coor points)))
                (random-in-range
                 (map exact->inexact (map y-coor points))))))
;; dependency
(define (random-in-range low high)
  (let ((range (- high low)))
    (+ low (random range))))

;;; test random-in-rect
(define p1 (make-point 3 4))
(define p2 (make-point 8 7))
(define r (make-rect p1 p2))
(random-in-rect r)
;; some float point in rect
#+END_SRC

... and so on
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; low-middle level
(define (make-rect bl tr)
  (define area
    (* (- (x-coor (tr) (bl)))
       (- (y-coor (tr) (bl)))))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'top-right) tr)
          ((eq? m 'bottom-left) bl)
          ((eq? m 'area) area)
          (else (error "Undefined request -- MAKE-RECT" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (top-right rect) (rect 'top-right))
(define (bottom-left rect) (rect 'bottom-left))

;;; test rect
(define p1 (make-point 3 4))
(define p2 (make-point 8 7))
(define r (make-rect p1 p2))
(r 'area)
;; 15
(top-right rect)
;; (8 . 7)
(bottom-left rect)
;; (3 . 4)
(rect 'unknown-message)
;; Undefined request -- MAKE-RECT unknown-message

;; lowest level
(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))
(define (x-coor pt) (car pt))
(define (y-coor pt) (cdr pt))

;;; test point
(define a (make-point 5 3))
(x-coor a)
;; 5
(y-coor a)
;; 3
#+END_SRC

Then we start the unit tests from the bottom. We failed in the =rect= level:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define r (make-rect p1 p2))
;The object (3 . 4) is not applicable.
#+END_SRC

As soon as we inspect the code of =make-rect=, we realize what the problem was.
We can fix this easily:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in make-rect
  (define area
    (* (- (x-coor tr) (x-coor bl))
       (- (y-coor tr) (y-coor bl))))
#+END_SRC

Run our test again: this time, we got by
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(top-right rect)
;Unbound variable: rect
#+END_SRC

It was due to the test code itself: we defined =r= to be rectangle but we called
=rect=. Fix and run. Then again we caught by =random-in-rect=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (random-in-rect r)
;The procedure #[compound-procedure 38 random-in-range] has been called with 1 argument; it requires exactly 2 arguments.
#+END_SRC

We should have used =apply= in the =random-in-rect= procedure to apply
=random-in-range= to argument list; after amending, it produce:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (random-in-rect r)
;Value: (5.225704578484133 . 5.665006074331469)
#+END_SRC

Looks fine.

Then we move up the top level. It produce:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (estimate-integral P r 100)
;Value: 76/25
#+END_SRC
If we convert that value to inexact number:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (exact->inexact 76/25)
;Value: 3.04
#+END_SRC

To produce the floating-point number at first, we need to give the x and y
coordinates with floating-point number. Let's do more trials:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (estimate-integral P r 1000)
;Value: 2.98
1 (user) => (estimate-integral P r 10000)
;Value: 3.158
1 (user) => (estimate-integral P r 100000)
;Value: 3.14068
#+END_SRC

It really slowly converge to 3.141592..., \pi.
*** Exercise 3.6
We can design what we requested using the message-passing programming strategy
as we did in =make-rect=. First let we code the test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; test rend
(rand 'generate)
<some-random-number>
((rand 'reset) 5)
(rand 'generate)
<specific-random-number>
(rand 'generate)
<some-other-random-number>
((rand 'reset) 5)
(rand 'generate)
<specific-random-number>
#+END_SRC

Then implement:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define rand
  (let ((x random-init))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'generate)
             (set! x (rand-update x))
             x)
            ((eq? m 'reset)
             (lambda (new-x)
               (set! x new-x)))
            (else
             error "Unknown request -- RAND" m)))))
#+END_SRC

As soon as I run the test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (rand 'generate)
;Unassigned variable: rand
#+END_SRC

I should have to return =dispatch= as its return value.

Let we run test again:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (rand 'generate)
;Value: 88
1 (user) => ((rand 'reset) 5)
;Value: 88
1 (user) => (rand 'generate)
;Value: 34
1 (user) => (rand 'generate)
;Value: 55
1 (user) => ((rand 'reset) 5)
;Value: 55
1 (user) => (rand 'generate)
;Value: 34
#+END_SRC

It works as expected.
** The Costs of Introducing Assignment
Allowing assignment expression in our language, introduce more profound
complication namely, what is the object and what is the sameness. It is more
alike philosophical concept. As noted in the text, to identify the sameness we
experiment by changing one object and observe the other; however in turns, to
define the "change" of one object we should first define "sameness." As
consequence, we need /a priori/ notion of sameness to identify whether the
objects that we are compare with is same.
*** Exercise 3.7
Let we first code the test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; test make-joint
(define peter-acc (make-account 100 'open-sesame))
(define paul-acc (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))
((paul-acc 'rosebud 'withdraw) 50)
;; 50
((peter-acc 'open-sesame 'deposit) 30)
;; 80
(define opaque (make-joint paul-acc 'open-sesame 'this-should-not-work?))
#+END_SRC
The last line is undefined because our specification does not regulate this
ambiguity. This looseness leads us to choose the implementation detail from
several possibilities:
- Let the last line of the test be valid :: This would imply to joint account,
     all we need to do is add new password to password list and then make change
     in =make-account= to check whether the password is correct use password
     list instead single password.
- Let the last line of the test be invalid :: This means that only the balance
     variable should be shared between the joint accounts, which also indicates
     that
     #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
((peter-acc 'rosebug 'deposit) 30)
     #+END_SRC
     should not work.


Let we explore the two possibilities by implementing both version.

- First version:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-account1 balance password)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (let ((n-incorrect 0)
        (pw-list (list password)))
    (define (dispatch pd m)
      (if (mem? pd pw-list)
          (begin
            (set! n-incorrect 0)        ;reset the counter
            (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
                  ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
                  ((eq? m 'joint) (lambda (new-pw)
                                    (set! pw-list (cons new-pw pw-list))
                                    dispatch))
                  (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT1"
                               m))))
          (lambda (x)
            (set! n-incorrect (1+ n-incorrect))
            (if (>= n-incorrect 7)
                "call-the-cops"
                "Incorrect password"))))
    dispatch))

(define (make-joint acc old-pw new-pw)
  ((acc old-pw 'joint) new-pw))

;; general helper function
(define (mem? el S)
  (if (null? S) false
      (or (eq? el (car S))
          (mem? el (cdr S)))))
  #+END_SRC

  Then let's test:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define peter-acc (make-account1 100 'open-sesame))

;Value: peter-acc

1 (user) => (define paul-acc (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))

;Value: paul-acc

1 (user) => ((paul-acc 'rosebud 'withdraw) 50)

;Value: 50

1 (user) => ((peter-acc 'open-sesame 'deposit) 30)

;Value: 80

1 (user) => (define opaque (make-joint paul-acc 'open-sesame 'this-should-not-work?))

;Value: opaque

1 (user) => ((opaque 'this-should-not-work? 'withdraw) 80)

;Value: 0
  #+END_SRC
- For the second version, as it is more tricky than the first one, first we
  should specify what we want. We want that the return account from =make-joint=
  should not share the password state variable with the account, with which
  =make-joint= called; yet want to share balance state variable among the
  two account. To accomplish this, we should have =make-account= with the
  following properties:
  1. We make object with unprotected account.
  2. Given that instance, we can convert that account to protected account with
     password.

  By restructuring =make-account= like this, we can easily implement the
  =make-joint=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (make-protected password)
    (let ((n-incorrect 0))
      (define (protected-dispatch pd m)
        (if (eq? pd password)
            (begin
              (set! n-incorrect 0)      ;reset the counter
              (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
                    ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
                    ((eq? m 'joint) (lambda (new-pw)
                                      ((dispatch 'make-protected) new-pw)))
                    (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-PROTECTED"
                                 m))))
            (lambda (x)
              (set! n-incorrect (1+ n-incorrect))
              (if (>= n-incorrect 7)
                  "call-the-cops"
                  "Incorrect password"))))
      protected-dispatch))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          ((eq? m 'make-protected) make-protected)
          (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                       m))))
  dispatch)

(define (make-account2 balance password)
  (((make-account balance) 'make-protected) password))
  #+END_SRC

  And here is the test:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define peter-acc (make-account2 100 'open-sesame))

;Value: peter-acc

1 (user) => (define paul-acc (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))

;Value: paul-acc

1 (user) => ((paul-acc 'rosebud 'withdraw) 50)

;Value: 50

1 (user) => ((peter-acc 'open-sesame 'deposit) 30)

;Value: 80

1 (user) => (define opaque (make-joint paul-acc 'open-sesame 'this-should-not-work?))

;Value: opaque

1 (user) => opaque

;Value: "Incorrect password"
  #+END_SRC


From this exercise, we can think procedure as an object in that notion of modern
programming language. Note that in second version of =make-account=, we used
procedure =dispatch= to call the parent object or the =self= in the modern
programming scheme.
*** Exercise 3.8
Note that to implement such =f=
- We should use assignment expression otherwise it doesn't depend on the
  evaluation order.
- As the arguments of =+= should be number and the procedure =+= is referential
  transparent, the specification can be divided as pure imperative part and pure
  functional part; that is, we can think the evaluation order left to right as
  imperative part:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
evaluate (f 0) => a
evaluate (f 1) => b
  #+END_SRC
  with functional part:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(+ a b) = 0
  #+END_SRC


Here is the sample implementation such =f=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define f
  (let ((x 0))
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0)
          x
          (begin (set! x n) 0)))))
#+END_SRC

Or more imperative-oriented version:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define f
  (let ((x 0))
    (lambda (n)
      (let ((temp x))
        (begin (set! x n)
               temp)))))
#+END_SRC

Then we can test the interpreter:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (+ (f 0) (f 1))

;Value: 1

,*** reevaluate f

1 (user) => (+ (f 1) (f 0))

;Value: 0
#+END_SRC

So, our interpreter evaluate augend first.
* Modeling with Mutable Data
** Mutable List Structure
*** Exercise 3.16
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (count-pairs x)
  (if (not (pair? x))
      0
      (+ (count-pairs (car x))
         (count-pairs (cdr x)))))

(define list1 (list 1 2 3))
(define list2
  (let ((tList (list 1 2 3)))
    (let ((tPointer (cdr tList)))
      (set-car! tPointer (cdr tPointer))
      tList)))

      (set-car! tPointer (cdr tPointer))
      (set-car! tList (cdr tList))
      tList)))
(define list4
  (let ((tList (list 1 2 3)))
    (set-car! tList tList)))
#+END_SRC
These list are all made up of exactly three pairs; but =count-pairs= returns
differently:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (count-pairs list1)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs list2)

;Value: 4

1 (user) => (count-pairs list3)

;Value: 7

1 (user) => (count-pairs list4)

;Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.17
Then our version should solve the problem Ben Bitdiddle encountered.
We can implement either of the paradigm, functional or imperative.
Functional:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (count-pairs x)
  (define (without-loop x visited)
    (if (or (mem? x visited) (not (pair? x)))
        0
        (let ((new-visited (cons x visited)))
          (+ (without-loop (car x) new-visited)
             (without-loop (cdr x) new-visited)
             1))))
  (without-loop x '()))
#+END_SRC

Unfortunately, this won't work:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list1)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list2)

;Value: 4

1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list3)

;Value: 7

1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list4)

;Value: 3
#+END_SRC

The problem is that in the recursive branch, each of it doesn't share the
=visited= argument. We can fix it by using local variable with assignment:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (count-pairs2 x)
  (define recorded
    (let ((visited '()))
      (lambda (x)
        (if (or (mem? x visited)
                (not (pair? x)))
            0
            (begin (set! visited (cons x visited))
                   (+ (recorded (car x))
                      (recorded (cdr x))
                      1))))))
  (recorded x))
#+END_SRC
As expected, it solved the problem:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (count-pairs2 list1)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs2 list2)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs2 list3)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs2 list4)

;Value: 3
#+END_SRC

Let we revise our functional version. To fix that, we should traverse the tree
structure like depth first search; we one of the branch should wait until the
other branch terminate its search. We should access the =visited= argument from
returned value of one branch to propagate that argument to other branch. By
returning tuple that contains =visited= with the counter, we can do the right thing:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (count-pairs1 x)
  (define (without-loop x visited)
    (if (or (mem? x visited) (not (pair? x)))
        (list 0 visited)
        (let ((result-of-one
               (without-loop (cdr x) (cons x visited))))
          (let ((result-of-the-other
                 (without-loop (car x) (cadr result-of-one))))
            (list (+ (car result-of-one)
                     (car result-of-the-other)
                     1)
                  (cadr result-of-the-other))))))
  (car (without-loop x '())))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list1)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list2)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list3)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (count-pairs1 list4)

;Value: 3
#+END_SRC

Implicitly, we used the induction on depth of =x= to construct this algorithm.
*** Exercise 3.18
This algorithm should look like that of previous exercise. Let we first code the
test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-cycle x)
  (set-cdr! (last-pair x) x)
  x)

(define (last-pair x)
  (if (null? (cdr x))
      x
      (last-pair (cdr x))))

(define list5 (make-cycle (list 1 2 3 4)))
(define list6 (append '(a b c d) list5))

(cycle? list1)
#f
(cycle? list2)
#f
(cycle? list3)
#f
(cycle? list4)
#f
(cycle? list5)
#t
(cycle? list6)
#t
(cycle? list7)
#t
#+END_SRC

Here is the code that exploits local state variable:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (cycle? x)
  (define iter
    (let ((visited '()))
      (lambda (x)
        (cond ((null? x) false)
              ((mem? x visited) true)
              (else
               (set! visited (cons x visited))
               (iter (cdr x)))))))
  (iter x))
#+END_SRC
... And test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (cycle? list1)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle? list2)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle? list3)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle? list4)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle? list5)

;Value: #t

1 (user) => (cycle? list6)

;Value: #t

1 (user) => (cycle? list7)

;Value: #t
#+END_SRC

As we wrote our test to be as exhaustive as possible, we can be quite confidence
about our program: We tested the extremum case such as =list7= with normal case
=list6= and =list5=.
*** Exercise 3.19
The keyword is *constant amount of space*; it implies we should code our code
iterative. And also since we operate on list, we need to fully understand what
the properties list structure possesses. If we focus on the convention that we
traverse list structure one way only-- =cdr= ing down, we could come up with the
"very clever" idea as noted in text book:
1. Send one person to stride one step further by =cdr= in each iteration where
2. Send the other one until the place where the first person stand checking
   whether the each pointer is same as of first person.
3. If it is, and if the two pointer located differently in examining list, then
   it is cycled list.
4. otherwise second person stride one step further.
5. If the second one reach the first one without trouble then first one stride
   one step further.
6. Loop from 2 to 5 until the first one reach nil pointer. If it reaches nil
   pointer then return false.


As this algorithm inherently evolve as iterative process, we got the algorithm
that we wanted. To implement the check algorithm that whether two pointer is
same but in different place, we could assign each pointer to number, namely the
step needed to get reached to that place. However, although it is subtle, this
strategy doesn't assure this assigned number doesn't grow in space: It would be
consume more space when the step get huge number. To cope with this situation we
can exploit the observation that, as our program return as soon as it found the
first cycle point, the different place but same pointer should have different
previous place where visited just before the current place.

Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (cycle1? x)
  (define first-man
    (let ((prev '()))
      (lambda (current)
        (define second-man
          (let ((prev2 '()))
            (lambda (current2)
              (if (eq? current current2)
                  (eq? prev prev2)
                  (begin (set! prev2 current2)
                         (second-man (cdr current2)))))))
        (cond ((null? current) false)
              ((not (second-man x)) true)
              (else
               (set! prev current)
               (first-man (cdr current)))))))
  (first-man x))
#+END_SRC

And the test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (cycle1? list1)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle1? list2)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle1? list3)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle1? list4)

;Value: #f

1 (user) => (cycle1? list5)

;Value: #t

1 (user) => (cycle1? list6)

;Value: #t

1 (user) => (cycle1? list7)

;Value: #t
#+END_SRC

Or functional version:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (cycle2? x)
  (define (first-man prev current)
    (define (second-man prev2 current2)
      (if (eq? current current2)
          (eq? prev prev2)
          (second-man current2 (cdr current2))))
    (cond ((null? current) false)
          ((not (second-man '() x)) true)
          (else
           (first-man current (cdr current)))))
  (first-man '() x))
#+END_SRC

We could use less =define= notation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (cycle3? x)
  (let ((first-man
         (lambda (prev current)
           (let ((second-man
                  (lambda (prev2 current2)
                    (if (eq? current current2)
                        (eq? prev prev2)
                        (second-man current2 (cdr current2))))))
             (cond ((null? current) false)
                   ((not (second-man '() x)) true)
                   (else
                    (first-man current (cdr current))))))))
    (first-man '() x)))
#+END_SRC

Unfortunately, this won't work:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (cycle3? list7)

;Unbound variable: first-man
#+END_SRC

To understand why, we can desugar =(let ((<var> <val>)) body)= expression as
=((lambda (<var>) body) <val>)=: The =lambda= expression in the first =let=
notation, there is no way to reference =first-man= in the body of =lambda=
expression of right-hand side; we need define to abstract this.
*** Lecture 5A: Assignment, State, and Side-effects
I've got quite intrigued by that if we can replace all the =set!= expression
with =define= ? (well, we supposed to not to do)

Let's experiment:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define t 1)

;Value: t

1 (user) => (define t (+ t 1))

;Value: t

1 (user) => t

;Value: 2
#+END_SRC

Seems like we could replace the use of =set!=; but:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define test
  (let ((t 1))
    (define t (+ t 1))
    t))
#+END_SRC

This definition won't work:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define test
  (let ((t 1))
    (define t (+ t 1))
    t))

;Unassigned variable: t
#+END_SRC

Do more experiment to grasp what's going on here:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define test
  (let ((t 1))
    (define t1 (+ t 1))
    (define t1 (+ t1 1))
    t))

;duplicate internal definitions for (#[uninterned-symbol 38 t1]) in |#[let-procedure]|
#+END_SRC

From these sequence of experiments, we can deduce that the effect of =define=,
which is similar with =set!=, is only allowed to REPL; in other words, only in
global environment. Within the evaluation model we learned so far, we can not
understand fully the behavior of =define=.

In lecture, professor start to define what means by the word "bound":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We say that a variable, V, is "bound in an expression", E, if the meaning of E
is unchanged by the uniform replacement of a variable, W, not occurring in E,
for every occurrence of V in E.
#+END_QUOTE

And also "free variable":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We say that a variable, V, is "free in and expression", E, if the meaning of E
is changed by the uniform replacement of a variable, W, not occurring in E, for
every occurrence of V in E.
#+END_QUOTE

By consequence of this, we have concept named "scope":
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If x is a bound variable in E then there is a lambda expression where it is
bound. We call the list of formal parameters of the lambda expression the "bound
variable list" and we say that the lambda expression "binds" the variables
"declared" in its bound variable list. In addition, those parts of the
expression where a variable has a value defined by the lambda expression which
binds it is called the "scope" of the variable.
#+END_QUOTE

The evaluation rule 1:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A procedure object is applied to a set of arguments by constructing a frame,
binding the formal parameters of the procedure to the actual arguments of the
call, and then evaluating the body of the procedure in the context of the new
environment constructed. The new fram has as its enclosing environment the
environment part of the procedure object being applied.
#+END_QUOTE

The evaluation rule 2:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A lambda-expression is evaluated relative to a given environment as follows: A
new procedure object is formed, combining the text (code) of the lambda
expression with a pointer to the environment of evaluation.
#+END_QUOTE

The terminologis about actions and identity:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We say that an action, A, had an effect on an object, X, (or equivalently, that
X was changed by A) if some property, P, which was true of X before A became
false of X after A.

We say that two objects, X and Y, are the same if any action which has an effect
on X has the same effect on Y.
#+END_QUOTE

Professor end the lecture with following quote:

Mr. Gilbert and Sullivan said,
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Things are seldom what they seem, 
Skim milk masquerades as cream...
#+END_QUOTE

He wanted to implies, I guess, the stream concept that would come up with following lecture; 
if we consider the meaning of quote in this specific context but it will convolve a lot more
profound meaning I think.
** Representing Queues
As we do usually, we build our data abstraction for our queue implementation:
- a constructor :: =(make-queue)= returns an empty queue.
- two selectors ::
  - =(empty-queue? <queue>)= tests if the queue is empty.
  - =(front-queue <queue>)= returns the object at the front of the queue,
    signaling an error if the queue is empty; it does not modify the queue.
- two mutators ::
  - =(insert-queue! <queue> <item>)= inserts the item at the front of the
    queue and returns the modified queue as its value.
  - =(delete-queue! <queue>)= removes the item at the front of the queue and
    returns the modified queue as its value, signaling an error if the queue is
    empty before the deletion.


For the implementation restriction, all the operation should require \Theta (1) steps.

In text book, they install additional layer, between manipulating queue
representation and implementing queue representation using list structure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; wrapping around the queue representation
(define (front-ptr queue) (car queue))
(define (rear-ptr queue) (cdr queue))
(define (set-front-ptr! queue item) (set-car! queue item))
(define (set-rear-ptr! queue item) (set-cdr! queue item))

;;; selector -- predicate
(define (empty-queue? queue) (null? (front-ptr queue)))

;;; constructor
(define (make-queue) (cons '() '()))

;;; selector -- first element
(define (front-queue queue)
  (if (empty-queue? queue)
      (error "FRONT called with an empty queue" queue)
      (car (front-ptr queue))))

;;; mutator -- insert item
(define (insert-queue! queue item)
  (let ((new-pair (cons item '())))
    (cond ((empty-queue? queue)
           (set-front-ptr! queue new-pair)
           (set-rear-ptr! queue new-pair)
           queue)
          (else
           (set-cdr! (rear-ptr queue)
                     new-pair)
           (set-rear-ptr! queue new-pair)
           queue))))

;;; mutator -- delete item
(define (delete-queue! queue)
  (cond ((empty-queue? queue)
         (error "DELETE! called with an empty queue" queue))
        (else
         (set-front-ptr! queue (cdr (front-ptr queue)))
         queue)))
#+END_SRC

*** Exercise 3.21
Eva Lu Ator denotes that it is just reachable from two different pointer not
that =insert-queue= inserts item twice; recall the exercise [[Exercise 3.16][3.16]], where all the
list has exactly three pairs in it but represented differently. (in both Ben
Bitdiddle's =count-pairs= and Lisp printer)

Here, to understand how the Lisp printer works, we implement the Lisp printer.
To implement that, we use nested induction -- induction on depth of expression
and within that, we run induction on width of expression. To deduce the
specification of Lisp printer, we play with Lisp interpreter for a while:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (cons 1 2)

;Value: (1 . 2)

1 (user) => (list 1 2)

;Value: (1 2)

1 (user) => (cons 1 (cons 2 3))

;Value: (1 2 . 3)

1 (user) => (cons (cons 1 2) 3)

;Value: ((1 . 2) . 3)

1 (user) => (cons 1 (cons 2 '()))

;Value: (1 2)
#+END_SRC

And here is the implementation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (print exp)
  (cond ((pair? exp) (print-exp exp))
        (else                           ;not compound
         (display exp))))

(define (print-exp exp)
  (define (iter exp)
    (cond ((null? exp))
          ((pair? exp)
           (display " ")
           (print (car exp))
           (iter (cdr exp)))
          (else
           (display " . ")
           (print exp))))
  (display "(")
  (print (car exp))
  (iter (cdr exp))
  (display ")"))
#+END_SRC

Here is the test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (print (cons 1 2))
(1 . 2)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print (list 1 2))
(1 2)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print (cons 1 (cons 2 3)))
(1 2 . 3)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print (cons (cons 1 2) 3))
((1 . 2) . 3)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print (cons 1 (cons 2 '())))
(1 2)
;Unspecified return value
#+END_SRC

Then here is the examples for what the Ben Bitdiddle misunderstood:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (print list3)
(((3) 3) (3) 3)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print list2)
(1 (3) 3)
;Unspecified return value
#+END_SRC

Consequently we can conclude that the Lisp printer display all the element
recursively following given pointer.

Actually, what version I use for now as scheme interpreter is smarter than that:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define q1 (make-queue))

;Value: q1

(insert-queue! q1 'a)

;Value: (#0=(a) . #0#)

(insert-queue! q1 'b)

;Value: ((a . #0=(b)) . #0#)

(delete-queue! q1)

;Value: (#0=(b) . #0#)

(delete-queue! q1)

;Value: (() b)
#+END_SRC

It recognize the same pointer using, I guess, memorize all the pointer it
encountered. But for now, let we stick the old version of printer in text book.

Return to our task, =print-queue= is really simple: Just print following the
first pointer of queue:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (print-queue queue)
  (display (front-ptr queue)))
#+END_SRC

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define q1 (make-queue))
;Value: q1

1 (user) => (print-queue (insert-queue! q1 'a))
(a)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print-queue (insert-queue! q1 'b))
(a b)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print-queue (delete-queue! q1))
(b)
;Unspecified return value

1 (user) => (print-queue (delete-queue! q1))
()
;Unspecified return value
#+END_SRC

Ben Bitdiddle should satisfy what =print-queue= display.
*** Exercise 3.22
We can map our previous implementation to message passing style by
- =(front-ptr queue)= \to =front-ptr= in =make-queue=
- =(rear-ptr queue)= \to =rear-ptr= in =make-queue=
- ...


It get boring to jot down all the relation; let I just show the result:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-queue2)
  (let ((front-ptr '())
        (rear-ptr '()))
    ;; selector -- predicate
    (define (empty-queue?) (null? front-ptr))
    ;; selector -- first item
    (define (front-queue)
      (if (empty-queue?)
          (error "FRONT called with an empty queue -- MAKE-QUEUE2" dispatch)
          (car front-ptr)))
    (define (insert-queue! item)
      (let ((new-pair (cons item '())))
        (cond ((empty-queue?)
               (set! front-ptr new-pair)
               (set! rear-ptr new-pair)
               dispatch)
              (else
               (set-cdr! rear-ptr new-pair)
               (set! rear-ptr new-pair)
               dispatch))))
    (define (delete-queue!)
      (cond ((empty-queue?)
             (error "DELETE! called with an empty queue -- MAKE-QUEUE2" dispatch))
            (else
             (set! front-ptr (cdr front-ptr))
             dispatch)))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'empty-queue?) empty-queue?)
            ((eq? m 'front-queue) front-queue)
            ((eq? m 'insert-queue!) insert-queue!)
            ((eq? m 'delete-queue!) delete-queue!)
            (else
             (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-QUEUE2" m))))
    dispatch))
#+END_SRC

And here is how we should use:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define q1 (make-queue2))

;Value: q1

1 (user) => ((q1 'insert-queue!) 'a)

;Value: #[compound-procedure 44 dispatch]

1 (user) => ((q1 'front-queue))

;Value: a

1 (user) => ((q1 'insert-queue!) 'b)

;Value: #[compound-procedure 44 dispatch]

1 (user) => ((q1 'front-queue))

;Value: a

1 (user) => ((q1 'delete-queue!))

;Value: #[compound-procedure 44 dispatch]

1 (user) => ((q1 'front-queue))

;Value: b

1 (user) => ((q1 'delete-queue!))

;Value: #[compound-procedure 44 dispatch]

1 (user) => ((q1 'front-queue))

;FRONT called with an empty queue -- MAKE-QUEUE2 #[compound-procedure 44 dispatch]
#+END_SRC

We can integrate =print-queue= to this procedure object:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-queue2)
  (let ((front-ptr '())
        (rear-ptr '()))
    ;; selector -- predicate
    (define (empty-queue?) (null? front-ptr))
    ;; selector -- first item
    (define (front-queue)
      (if (empty-queue?)
          (error "FRONT called with an empty queue -- MAKE-QUEUE2" dispatch)
          (car front-ptr)))
    (define (insert-queue! item)
      (let ((new-pair (cons item '())))
        (cond ((empty-queue?)

Note that with this local state paradigm, message passing style is more
succinctly encode the specification than the representation using concrete data
structure-- here pair.

*** Exercise 3.23
Not only to traverse one way-- =cdr=, we need means to traverse the opposite
way to implement /deque/. As we requested in implementation of queue, we need to
implement all the operation in \Theta (1) steps.

Here we devise new data structure not only /deque/, also /node/ with which we
represent /deque/. /Node/ has many analogy with primitive data structure, pair;
it construct one chunk using several pointers together, but /node/ has three
pointers in one chunk whereas pair has two pointers in it.

Here is the specification for /node/:
- constructor :: =(make-node prev item next)= returns node that has three
     pointers, each of which points =prev=, =item=, =next=, respectively.
- selectors ::
     - =(prev node)= returns first pointer.
     - =(item node)= returns second pointer.
     - =(next node)= returns last pointer.
- mutators ::
     - =(set-prev! node new-prev)= resets its pointer that points =prev= to =new-prev=.
     - =(set-item! node new-item)= resets its pointer that points =item= to =new-item=.
     - =(set-next! node new-next)= resets its pointer that points =next= to =new-next=.


Here is the implementation for /node/:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; constructor
(define (make-node prev item next)
  (define (set-prev! new-prev) (set! prev new-prev))
  (define (set-item! new-item) (set! item new-item))
  (define (set-next! new-next) (set! next new-next))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'prev) prev)
          ((eq? m 'item) item)
          ((eq? m 'next) next)
          ((eq? m 'set-prev!) set-prev!)
          ((eq? m 'set-item!) set-item!)
          ((eq? m 'set-next!) set-next!)
          (else
           (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-NODE" m))))
  dispatch)

;;; selectors
(define (prev node) (node 'prev))
(define (item node) (node 'item))
(define (next node) (node 'next))

;;; mutators
(define (set-prev! node new-prev) ((node 'set-prev!) new-prev))
(define (set-item! node new-item) ((node 'set-item!) new-item))
(define (set-next! node new-next) ((node 'set-next!) new-next))
#+END_SRC

Then we can implement /deque/ using the analogy with /queue/. During
implementing node, queue, and the other massage passing style code, I got
intrigued by how am I going to implement the conventional array in scheme using
massage passing style; it should access its element with \Theta (1) steps. So
far, in message passing style, we dealt with only fixed sized argument list.

One way to deal with unspecified argument list is use the primitive procedure
syntax, e.g. =(x y . z)=; but the problem of this approach is that to access the
contents that stored in =z=, as it is list, needs \Theta (n) steps where n is
the size of =z=. To deal with this unfortunate, if we believe that accessing any
variable in the frame require only \Theta(1) steps, we need to register all the
argument of =z= (with =x= and =y= also) current environment of callee, for which
we don't have any method.

Let alone that problem let we conclude our original task. First let test our
node code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (define n (make-node '() 2 '()))

;Value: n

1 (user) => (define n2 (make-node n 3 '()))

;Value: n2

1 (user) => (item n)

;Value: 2

1 (user) => (item n2)

;Value: 3

1 (user) => (item (prev n2))

;Value: 2

1 (user) => (define n3 (make-node '() 4 '()))

;Value: n3

1 (user) => (set-next! n2 n3)

;Value: ()

1 (user) => (set-prev! n3 n2)

;Value: ()

1 (user) => (item (prev (prev n3)))

;Value: 2

** Representing Tables
In chapter 2, we exploited a lot the data structure named /table/. /Table/ was
the backbone our data-directed programming scheme. Table is so general data
structure to the extent many of the "practical" programming languages provides
table as one of the primitive data structure. In Lisp, we don't have any table
like structure for granted. But we can implement that data structure by our own
if we allowed to use assignment.

Then what is table? What data structure we think as table? Here we define what
we think as table informally:
- We should be able to retrieve the registered value in the table by its key.
- We should be able to insert new entry, which contains key value pair-like
  structure, to the table.


More formally table should satisfy following axioms:
- =(lookup key (begin (insert! (make-entry key value) table) table))=
  returns =value=.


What value =(lookup not-in-the-table table)= should returns is implementation
detail. The implementor can choose whatever value we want unless the specifier
doesn't specify to that extent.

For the implementation detail, we need to use /headed/ list as the backbone of
our table to insert given entry to the given table; without this, we couldn't
locate the locus of the table's contents.

Here is the sample implementation in text book:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; constructor
(define (make-table)
  (list '*table*))

;;; selector + predicate
(define (lookup key table)
  (let ((record (assoc key (cdr table))))
    (if record
        (cdr record)
        false)))
;;; dependency
;;; we represent contents of table as A-list
(define (assoc key records)
  (cond ((null? records) false)
        ((equal? key (caar records)) (car records))
        (else (assoc key (cdr records)))))

;;; mutator
(define (insert! key value table)
  (let ((record (assoc key records)))
    (if record
        (set-cdr! record value)
        (set-cdr! table
                  (cons (cons key value)
                        (cdr table)))))
  'ok)
#+END_SRC

*** Two-dimensional tables
We can extend one-dimensional table above to two-dimensional table by observing
that each value of one-dimensional table could be A-list. As the key of the
subtables performs as header, we don't need any auxiliary header as we did in
one-dimensional table.

As we noted above, all the left is to implement two dimensional lookup procedure
and insert accordingly:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (lookup key-1 key-2 table)
  (let ((subtable (assoc key-1 (cdr table))))
    (if subtable
        (let ((record (assoc key-2 (cdr subtable))))
          (if record
              (cdr record)
              false))
        false)))

(define (insert! key-1 key-2 value table)
  (let ((subtable (assoc key-1 (cdr table))))
    (if subtable
        (let ((record (assoc key-2 (cdr subtable))))
          (if record
              (set-cdr! record value)
              (set-cdr! subtable
                        (cons (cons key-2 value)
                              (cdr subtable)))))
        (set-cdr! table
                  (cons (list key-1
                              (cons key-2 value))
                        (cdr table)))))
  'ok)
#+END_SRC
*** Creating local tables

  (let ((local-table (list '*table*)))
    (define (lookup key-1 key-2)
      (let ((subtable (assoc key-1 (cdr local-table))))
        (if subtable
            (let ((record (assoc key-2 (cdr subtable))))
              (if record
                  (cdr record)
                  false))
            false)))
    (define (insert! key-1 key-2 value)

It is equivalent to prove the behavior of the specification: Induction on depth
of the table. If we persist with the A-list representation as before, and also
assume that all the generalized table structured appropriately, we can easily
extend the previous table to generalized one:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (lookup key-list table)
  (cond ((null? key-list)
         (error "LOOKUP called with empty key-list"))
        ((null? (cdr key-list))
         (let ((record (assoc (car key-list) (cdr table))))
           (if record
               (cdr record)
               false)))
        (else
         (let ((subtable (assoc (car key-list) (cdr table))))
           (if subtable

(define (insert! key-list value table)

        ((null? (cdr key-list))

I didn't tested it but it would work only if we lookup the table that contains
entry with key list with which we lookup. Unfortunately, it is huge bug, since
the user of lookup doesn't know whether the table has such entry. To fix this,
we make our table using the strategy learned from lecture, [[youtube:bWJlEevfp1E?list=PL7BcsI5ueSNFPCEisbaoQ0kXIDX9rR5FF][Abstract Data Type]].

In previous exercise, we only dealt with table of fixed dimension; we don't need
to check whether the value of given entry is table or not. Here we don't know
fore hand the dimension of table, and to deal with such situation, we treat
table as special value of one dimensional table. By induction on the depth on
the dimension of table, our result table would handle the unspecified dimension
of table without any trouble.

At our disposal, we have two candidates for implementation of this:
message-passing style with local state or dispatch on data type with concrete
data structure.

Here we first try out the message-passing style:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

Note that the latter one is more efficient than former one; also seems cleaner.

*** Exercise 3.26
As we already implemented the lookup procedure for binary tree in [[org:../MEGAsync/MIT%20Challenge/6.001/Chapter2.org][exercise 2.66]].
All the left is to implement constructor and mutator of table.

With the same argument of headed list-- our first backbone of table, we need to
tag a type to locate "place" to mutate table.

Here for simplicity, we don't consider the "balance" of tree structure; but that
issue can be dealt with using amortized algorithm.

Here's the result:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; constructor
(define (make-table6)
  (cons table-tag '()))

(define (lookup key table)
  (let ((entry (assoc-tree key (cdr table))))

  (if (null? tree)
      false
      (let ((hd (key (entry tree))))
        (cond ((= given-key hd) (entry tree))
              ((< given-key hd) (assoc-tree given-key (left-branch tree)))
              ((> given-key hd) (assoc-tree given-key (right-branch tree)))))))

;; mutator
(define (insert! key value table)

                  (make-tree-with-entry (make-entry key value)))
        (insert-tree! key value tree))))

(define (insert-tree! aKey aValue tree)
  (let ((hd (key (entry tree))))

*** Exercise 3.27
I've drawed environment diagram in my personal digital paper. To analysis the
step complexity of =memo-fib=, let we assume that our =memo-fib= procedure does
not compute the result of the argument that previously called with -- actually
this is the reason we use memoization for -- by wishful thinking. Then note
that, for instance, if our entry point -- the first procedure call -- was made
by =(memo-fib 7)=, depending on how our the interpreter works, it should compute
after some step =(memo-fib 6)= (or =(memo-fib 5)=) followed by =(memo-fib 5)=
(or =(memo-fib 6)=); observe when it comes to the latter point of computation
the result of that should already be in the local table of =memo-fib= by the
assumption. Nevertheless, in any circumstance, if we let $T(n)$ denote the step
complexity of =(memo-fib n)= then we get \[T(n) - T(n - 1) = \Theta(1)\] from
which, we can conclude that \[T(n) = \Theta(n)\].

To prove our assumption, we need to argue in our environment model for
evaluation, which just complicate our discussion; yet we can grasp the taste of
it by simulating (drawing) the evaluation process using environment model.
** A Simulator for Digital Circuits
Here we implement /event-driven simulation/; usually we encounter event-driven
programming in web developing -- JavaScript, ruby on rails, and so on. For
instance, we develop language for digital circuits simulator.

As the name of our language, simulator, indicates that we model real world
object exploiting local state variable.

As a powerful language should consist of primitive elements, means of combination, means of
abstraction, our simulator language also composed by those:
- primitive elements :: Digital circuits constructed by combination of simple
     logical function boxes:
     #+CAPTION: Logical function boxes
    [[./image/ch3-Z-G-24.gif]]
     - Inverter
     - And-gate
     - Or-gate
- means of combination :: We can construct more complex function boxes using
     previous ones: Using wiring up the components.
- means of abstraction :: As we embed our language in scheme, we inherit
     scheme's means of abstraction -- =define=.


Note that we described above components using real world terminology since we
assumed that we mapped that concept to our language.

For instance, let we construct half-adder circuit:
#+CAPTION: half-adder

[[./image/ch3-Z-G-25.gif]]
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; consturct half-adder
(define a (make-wire))
(define b (make-wire))
(define c (make-wire))
(define d (make-wire))
(define e (make-wire))
(define s (make-wire))
(or-gate a b d)
(and-gate a b c)
(inverter c e)
(and-gate d e s)
#+END_SRC

As this is general function box, it would be more appropriate to abstract this
as box:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (half-adder a b s c)
  (let ((d (make-wire)) (e (make-wire)))
    (or-gate a b d)
    (and-gate a b c)
    (inverter c e)
    (and-gate d e s)
    ))
#+END_SRC

Using this function box, we can construct more useful, complex function box:
#+caption: full-adder
[[./image/ch3-Z-G-26.gif]]
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (full-adder a b c-in sum c-out)
  (let ((s (make-wire))
        (c1 (make-wire))
        (c2 (make-wire)))
    (half-adder b c-in s c1)
    (half-adder a s sum c2)
    (or-gate c1 c2 c-out)
    'ok))
#+END_SRC

*** Primitive function boxes
The primitive function boxes works as force the wire get its signal changed. So
wire should provides appropriate operations for that:
- =(get-signal <wire>)=
  returns the current value of the signal on wire.
- =(set-signal <wire> <new value>)=
  changes the value of the signal on the wire to the new value.
- =(add-action! <wire> <procedure of no arguments>)=
  asserts that the designated procedure should be run whenever the signal on the
  wire changes value. Such procedures are the vehicles by which changes in the
  signal value on the wire are communicated to other wires.


Note that the first two operations should be familiar with us -- selector and
mutator; but the last one is specific for the /event-driven programming/. By
this effect, the "force" propagates along with the wires.

In addition, to reflect the delay of logical function boxes, we need to make use
of a procedure =after-delay= that takes a time delay and a procedure to be run
and executes the given procedure after the given delay.

As we gathered all the components we need, let's define the primitive function
boxes:
- inverter
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (inverter input output)
  (define (invert-input)
    (let ((new-value (logical-not (get-signal input))))
      (after-delay inverter-delay
                   (lambda ()
                     (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! input invert-input)
  'ok)

(define (logical-not s)
  (cond ((= s 0) 1)
        ((= s 1) 0)
        (else (error "Invalid signal" s))))
  #+END_SRC
  Note that whenever the input signal changes =invert-input= executed by the
  =add-action!=
- and-gate
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (and-gate a1 a2 output)
  (define (and-action-procedure)
    (let ((new-value
           (logical-and (get-signal a1) (get-signal a2))))
      (after-delay and-gate-delay
                   (lambda ()
                     (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! a1 and-action-procedure)
  (add-action! a2 and-action-procedure)
  'ok)
(define (logical-and s1 s2)
  (cond ((and (= s1 0) (= s2 0)) 0)
        ((and (= s1 0) (= s2 1)) 0)
        ((and (= s1 1) (= s2 0)) 0)
        ((and (= s1 1) (= s2 1)) 1)
        (else (error "Invalid signals" (cons s1 s2)))))
  #+END_SRC
- or-gate
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (or-gate a1 a2 output)
  (define (or-action-procedure)
    (let ((new-value
           (logical-or (get-signal a1) (get-signal a2))))
      (after-delay or-gate-delay
                   (lambda ()
                     (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! a1 or-action-procedure)
  (add-action! a2 or-action-procedure)
  'ok)
(define (logical-or s1 s2)
  (cond ((and (= s1 0) (= s2 0)) 0)
        ((and (= s1 0) (= s2 1)) 1)
        ((and (= s1 1) (= s2 0)) 1)
        ((and (= s1 1) (= s2 1)) 1)
        (else (error "Invalid signals" (cons s1 s2)))))
  #+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.28
See the above or-gate part.
*** Exercise 3.29
We can use either De Morgan's law or truth table to deduce following logic:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (or-gate2 a1 a2 output)
  (let ((not-a1 (make-wire))
        (not-a2 (make-wire))
        (not-or (make-wire)))
    (inverter a1 not-a1)
    (inverter a2 not-a2)
    (and-gate not-a1 not-a2 not-or)
    (inverter not-or output)
    'ok))
#+END_SRC
=or-gate-delay= becomes 2 =inverter-delay= + =and-gate-delay=.
*** Exercise 3.30
Using induction on /n/, we can construct /ripple-carry-adder/. More
specifically, to connect each full-adder boxes, we should hand over the carry
wire to next full-adder box:
#+caption: ripple carry adder
[[./image/ch3-Z-G-27.gif]]
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (ripple-carry-adder aAs aBs aSs C)
  (define (connect-and-return-carry Ak Bk Ck Sk)
    (let ((C_k-1 (make-wire)))
      (full-adder Ak Bk Ck Sk C_k-1)
      C_k-1))
  (define (connect-recursive As Bs Ss)
    (cond ((and (null? As) (null? Bs) (null? Ss))
           (make-wire))                          ;C_n
          ((or (null? As) (null? Bs) (null? Ss)) ;defensive programming
           (error
            "arguments do not agree in the number of elements --RIPPLE-CARRY-ADDER"
            (list aAs aBs aSs)))
          (else
           (connect-and-return-carry
            (car As) (car Bs)
            (connect-recursive (cdr As) (cdr Bs) (cdr Ss))
            (car Ss)))))
  (cond ((or (null? aAs) (null? aBs) (null? aSs))
         (error "RIPPLE-CARRAY-ADDER cannot do connect with given arguemens"
                (list aAs aBs aSs)))
        (else (full-adder (car aAs)
                          (car aBs)
                          (connect-recursive ;C_1
                           (cdr aAs)
                           (cdr aBs)
                           (cdr aSs))
                          (car aSs)
                          C)
              'ok)))
#+END_SRC


To estimate the whole delay of ripple carry adder, we exploit abstraction over
the delays of other simpler function boxes that constitute ripple carry adder.
Observe that the delay from /C_{k}/ to /C_{k-1}/ accumulated; it would be the
bottle neck of propagation of signal in this function box. So we can conclude
that the whole delay of ripple carry adder would be approximately /n/ \times
each of the delay that going to be accumulated.

In turns, to estimate the each delay of that part of full-adder, we need to do the same
process as above or we could "bottom up" approach to it; calculate from the
very lower level of function boxes from which full-adder constructed:
- From half-adder, we have =or-gate-delay= + =and-gate-delay= or 2
  =and-gate-delay= + =inverter-delay= to propagate the
  signal from inputs to the =s=.
- From full-adder, we have 2 (=or-gate-delay= + =and-gate-delay=) or 3
  =and-gate-delay= + =inverter-delay= + =or-gate-delay= to propagate from =c-in=
  to =c-out=.


So, if we stick with =or-gate= and =and-gate= combination only, we got /n/
\times 2 (=or-gate-delay= + =and-gate-delay=) as whole. We will verify this when
we implemented all the parts of our language.
*** Representing wires
By wishful thinking, we just used wires to connect the components of our
primitive boxes until now; this time, we need to represent wires according to
our use of that -- the specifications deduced from our use.

Our wire should have signal as its state variable from the use of that; i.e.
=(get-signal <wire>)= and =(set-signal! <wire> <new value>)=. Also it should
have some way to save all the actions it should executes when it change its
signal according to =(add-action! <wire> <procedure of no arguments>)=; the
name's bang of usage implies wire should have "action list" as its state
variable.

Here, in text book, we implement wire using the message passing style:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-wire)
  (let ((signal-value 0) (action-procedures '()))
    (define (set-my-signal! new-value)
      (if (not (= signal-value new-value))
          (begin (set! signal-value new-value)
                 (call-each action-procedures))
          'done))
    (define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
      (set! action-procedures (cons proc action-procedures))
      (proc))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'get-signal) signal-value)
            ((eq? m 'set-signal!) set-my-signal!)
            ((eq? m 'add-action!) accept-action-procedure!)
            (else (error "Unknown operation -- WIRE" m))))
    dispatch))

(define (call-each procedures)
  (if (null? procedures)
      'done
      (begin
        ((car procedures))
        (call-each (cdr procedures)))))
#+END_SRC

Then set up the interface for procedure calling style:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (get-signal wire)
  (wire 'get-signal))
(define (set-signal! wire new-value)
  ((wire 'set-signal!) new-value))
(define (add-action! wire action-procedure)
  ((wire 'add-action!) action-procedure))
#+END_SRC
*** The agenda
Only the =after-delay= left to complete our language. We need some data
structure that contains the schedule of things to do. For that structure we make
data structure called agenda. Here is the interface of agenda:
- =(make-agenda)=
  returns a new empty agenda
- =(empty-agenda? <agenda>)=
  is true if the specified agenda is empty.
- =(first-agenda-item <agenda>)=
  returns the first item on the agenda.
- =(remove-first-agenda-item! <agenda>)=
  modifies the agenda by removing the first item.
- =(add-to-agenda! <time> <action> <agenda>)=
  modifies the agenda by adding the given action procedure to be run at the
  specified time.
- =(current-time <agenda>)=
  returns the current simulation time.


We also used the wishful thinking to construct this interface. The particular
agenda that we use along the simulation is denoted as =the-agenda=. Using this
structure we can implement =after-delay= procedure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (after-delay delay action)
  (add-to-agenda! (+ delay (current-time the-agenda))
                  action
                  the-agenda))
#+END_SRC

With this data structure, we are ready to implement the initiation of simulator:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (propagate)
  (if (empty-agenda? the-agenda)
      'done
      (let ((first-item (first-agenda-item the-agenda)))
        (first-item)
        (remove-first-agenda-item! the-agenda)
        (propagate))))
#+END_SRC
*** A sample simulation
Cool! Since we can start the simulation, and we got the all the components of
simulation, we are done only if we represent the agenda data structure? No! We
can't inspect the simulation: We only can inspect whether the simulation done by
=propagate=. To cope with this, we implement =probe= procedure that print out
all the events at given wire:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (probe name wire)
  (add-action! wire
               (lambda ()
                 (newline)
                 (display name)
                 (display " ")
                 (display (current-time the-agenda))
                 (display "  New-value = ")
                 (display (get-signal wire)))))
#+END_SRC

We exploited the underlying operation for =wire=.

We are really ready to start the simulation. Here is the sample simulation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; setup
(define the-agenda (make-agenda))
(define inverter-delay 2)
(define and-gate-delay 3)
(define or-gate-delay 5)
(define input-1 (make-wire))
(define input-2 (make-wire))
(define sum (make-wire))
(define carry (make-wire))
(probe 'sum sum)
(probe 'carry carry)

;;; set situation and start
(half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)
(set-signal! input-1 1)
(propagate)

;;; second situation and start
(set-signal! input-2 1)
(propagate)
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.31
We can analyze this problem in two different ways (but not mutually
independent):
- Focus the mapping between real world situation, from which we modeled, with
  our resulting model.
- Experiment with the alternative and see what happen then evaluate its result
  (actually to estimate the result, we would use the first way).


Let we start with the latter method and then evaluate that with the first
method. As we did not complete our simulation language, we should simulate with
their definitions; in other word, we should evaluate each statement as if we
become a interpreter.

With the normal definition of =accept-action-procedure!=, already the result of
simulation texted in text book; so here we need only to simulate with the
following definition on our own:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in make-wire
(define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
  (set! action-procedures (cons proc action-procedures)))
#+END_SRC

Let's run our interpreter:
1. evaluate =(half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)=; at this point
   =(empty-agenda? the-agenda)= returns true as we don't run the action since
   the input signals doesn't changed at all.
2. evaluate =(set-signal! input-1 1)=; as referencing the half-adder diagram,
   the agenda should contains the schedule that looks like
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(
 (3 (lambda ()
      (set-signal!
       carry
       (logical-and
        (get-signal input-1) (get-signal input-2)))))
 (5 (lambda ()
      (set-signal!
       d
       (logical-or (get-signal input-1) (get-signal input-2)))))
 )
   #+END_SRC

   The first item of each element represent the scheduled time and the next is
   the action to be executed at that time.

   Here I've used the substitution model for evaluation; but it is not strictly
   correct -- the value of evaluating logical-and or logical-or should be
   captured when the connection being made for instance.
3. evaluate =(propagate)=;
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-signal!
 carry
 (logical-and
  (get-signal input-1) (get-signal input-2)))
   #+END_SRC
   evaluated to
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-signal! carry 0)
   #+END_SRC
   which cause no change at all.

   Next evaluate
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(lambda ()
      (set-signal!
       d
       (logical-or (get-signal input-1) (get-signal input-2))))
   #+END_SRC
   to
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-signal! d 1)
   #+END_SRC
   ; as =d= changed its signal, it causes further events:
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(
 (8 (lambda ()
      (set-signal!
       sum
       (logical-and
        (get-signal d) (get-signal e)))))
 )
   #+END_SRC

   As
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-signal! sum 0)
   #+END_SRC
   doesn't change the signal of =sum=, it finalize the simulation: ='done=.


The evaluation of this simulation is different from previous: =sum= and =carry=
doesn't change its signal at all.

Now we evaluate the result of our simulation using the criterion of first
method:
Our real world situation indicates the previous one is correct: the modified one
is different from what "really" happens.

Let we conclude with the first method, in this time, it is irrelevant with the
second method. We observe in real world that as soon as we connect each
components of digital circuits, the signals of wires, which connect each
component, affected by its action -- connecting. Therefore, the initialization
in the =accept-action-procedure!= is necessary when we really want to model that
situation.
*** Implementing the agenda
The agenda is made up of /time segments/; to reflect this structure, we provide
the backbone of agenda from which agenda constructed up:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-time-segment time queue)
  (cons time queue))
(define (seqment-time s) (car s))
(define (segment-queue s) (cdr s))
#+END_SRC

It doesn't do any special things except it indicates our strategy that we going
to use queue for accumulating action procedures to be executed at that time. In
fact, this is due to limitation of our programming language, as it does not
allow us to use concurrent process, we need to mimic the situation all the
procedures executed at once in our sequential language -- using queue.

As we noted before, the agenda itself is a one-dimensional table of time
segments. It is ordered by increasing time, it has /current time/ as its head:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; constructor
(define (make-agenda) (list 0))
;; selector -- time
(define (current-time agenda) (car agneda))
;; mutator -- time
(define (set-current-time! agenda time)
  (set-car! agenda time))
;; selector -- segments
(define (segments agenda) (cdr agenda))
;; mutator -- segments
(define (set-segments! agenda segments)
  (set-cdr! agenda segments))
;; selector -- operating on segments
(define (first-segment agenda) (car (segments agenda)))
;; selector -- operating on segments
(define (rest-segments agenda) (cdr (segments agenda)))

;; predicate agenda
(define (empty-agenda? agenda)
  (null? (segments agenda)))
#+END_SRC

To add a new action to agenda, we choose to mutate our agenda structure. It
make us confront with some tricky situation, which would not occur in functional
programming. We need to maintain the structure to preserve its identity after
mutating the structure -- as we did in table implementation. So we need to
follow somewhat more tricky algorithm specified in text book:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (add-to-agenda! time action agenda)
  (define (belongs-before? segments)
    (or (null? segments)
        (< time (segment-time (car segments)))))
  (define (make-new-time-segment time action)
    (let ((q (make-queue)))
      (insert-queue! q action)
      (make-new-time-segment time q)))
  (define (add-to-segments! segments)
    (if (= (segment-time (car segments)) time)
        (insert-queue! (segment-queue (car segments))
                       action)
        (let ((rest (cdr segments)))
          (if (belongs-before? rest)
              (set-cdr!
               segments
               (cons (make-new-time-segment time action)
                     rest))
              (add-to-segments! rest)))))
  (let ((segments (segments agenda)))   ;handle the entry point
    (if (belongs-before? segments)
        (set-segments!
         agenda
         (cons (make-new-tiem-segment time action)
               segments))
        (add-to-segments! segments))))
#+END_SRC

The remover:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (remove-first-agenda-item! agenda)
  (let ((q (segment-queue (first-segment agenda))))
    (delete-queue! q)
    (if (empty-queue? q)
        (set-segments! agenda (rest-segments agenda)))))
#+END_SRC

Finally the access to the agenda from the higher level user:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (first-agenda-item agenda)
  (if (empty-agenda? agenda)
      (error "Agenda is empty -- FIRST-AGENDA-ITEM")
      (let ((first-seg (first-segment agenda)))
        (set-current-time! agenda (segment-time first-seg)) ;first item access renew the time
        (front-queue (segment-queue first-seg))))) ;from the contract, queue is not empty
#+END_SRC

Then let's test with previous exercise, [[Exercise 3.31][Exercise 3.31]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
1 (user) => (half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)

;Value: ok

1 (user) => (set-signal! input-1 1)

;Value: done

1 (user) => (propagate)

;Value: done

1 (user) => (set-signal! input-2 1)

;Value: done

1 (user) => (propagate)

carry 11  New-value = 1
;Value: done
#+END_SRC

It is exactly what we expected.
*** Exercise 3.32

We reason as follows:
1. By the observation of previous exercise, each action stored in one wire
   executed when the signal of that wire has changed.
2. As queue is FIFO, even if it is same time at which the actions to be
   executed, it is important which one has added to agenda.
3. There are two possibilities in this particular situation:
   - 0,1 \to 1,1 \to 1,0 -- abbreviated form of that first transit from 0,1 to
     1,1 (the first argument change its signal) and then transit from 1,1 to 1,0
     (the second argument change its signal).
   - 0,1 \to 0,0 \to 1,0
4. Case 1: output \to 1 \to 0 -- output of and-gate transit from its initial
   signal (0) to 1 and then 0 at the same time point.
   Case 2: output is unchanged.
5. Case 1 would cause further event propagation; Case 2 would not. But with the
   current primitive function boxes, after done with propagation, we can't
   notice the difference between Case 1 from Case 2.
6. Now let we assume list structure not queue: LIFO; with the same reasoning as
   with queue, the order of action is important also.
7. Case 1 would be stacked as (1,1 \to 1,0) (0,1 \to 1,1) as =and-gate-action=
   capture the signals of wires when it called not the execution time of that action.
8. That cause output \to unchanged \to 1
9. Whereas, Case 2 stacked as follows: (0,0 \to 1,0) (0,1 \to 0,0), which cause
   the output unchanged at all.
10. Conclusion: If we use list instead of queue, new the order in which actions
    to be executed start to get mattered; also in the view point of modeling, it
    doesn't reflect well what behavior the real world takes.
** Lecture 5B: Computational Objects
In [[youtube:yedzRWhi-9E?list=PLE18841CABEA24090][this lecture]], we are going to learn how we use computational object -- the
object of message passing paradigm -- to model the real world object; that is,
mapping the objects from the real world to our computational world as well as
all the relations between the objects. In lecture, it brings digital circuit
simulation as example of instantiation of outlined scheme.

The steps of the conversion, from model of real world to our computational
model, can be summarized as follows:
1. Capture the behavior of real world object that we want to map to our minds.
   It requires more subtle steps for itself; the main concept of that steps is
   to abstract the behavior as formally as possible.

   In the digital circuit example, the primitive function boxes would be that --
   inverter, and-gate, or-gate in addition to wire.
2. Then formalize captured behavior using the state and mutation languages (more
   specifically using the wishful thinking!).

   In the example of lecture, each the cloudy wire object has to have signal
   "state" with action procedures list "state" which stores things to inform
   when it has changed its own signal value.
3. Turn the language of state and mutation to the language of environment model.
   Environment model can deal with the evaluation involving mutation and
   assignment as well as the other expressions, we can safely map all the stuff
   of the wishful thinking involving computational object as instantiation of
   environment model.

   In the example of digital circuit, wire is the environment which possess
   signal and action procedures as variable in its first frame; the references
   between the objects resolved as bindings in frame.
4. Convert the environment model to code which produce such environments. We
   have learned the instance of environment model that given code produces; if
   we approach backwards, we can get what we want as there is one to one mapping
   between the environment diagram and that code.

   In the example of the digital circuit, there are more than what we outlined
   here: as we are going to code digital circuit "simulation", we need to code
   the fragments to achieve simulation feature such as delay of propagation and
   so on. The agenda data structure is one of the auxiliary parts we mentioned
   above.


For the latter part of the example, it involves another key concept: Designing
ADT -- in lecture, the agenda structure. To design and implement ADT,
1. By wishful thinking, come up with behaviors that we want to have.
2. Formalize the captured behavior as ADT.
3. Modeling that behavior using our environment model (or box and pointer
   diagram if it can be done that way).
4. Convert that into code as there is direct mapping between code and model as
   we specified above.


The only difference between this and above modeling of real world object is
that for designing ADT, there is no need to exist in the real world what we want
to capture; if we can imagine what we want, we can capture that in computational
object.
** Propagation of Constraints
Here we implement the constraint-based programming -- non-directional
computations. There are some mechanisms works in this way in the real world --
mechanics of material and so on. This constraint-based programming also known as
logical programming combined with pattern matching. In that paradigm, all the
constraints works as /fact/. Using such /facts/, deduce unknown things if
appropriate amounts of fact provided.

To implement such programming style, we apply what we learned in [[Lecture 5B:
Computational Objects][Lecture 5B: Computational Objects]]:
*** Capture the behavior of real world scheme.
We could start this using the mechanical example we described; but to begin, the
simpler example we use, the easier to capture the common behavior of those
scheme, which leads capturing the abstracted concept of those behavior.

So here, we use the conversion of temperature between of Fahrenheit and of
Celsius. The relationship can be formalize as
\[9C = 5(F - 32)\]

*** Then we have to capture that as frame of components of ADT or a programming language.
Here as we develop the programming style, we need to fit our
components into
  - primitive elements:
    As we develop constraint-based programming our primitive elements would be
    /primitive constraints/ -- primitive adder, multiplier, and constant
    constraint
  - means of combination:
    Analogous to the digital circuit simulation, we combine constraints
    connecting by connectors. Connectors work similarly with wires.
  - means of abstraction:
    As we embedding this language into Scheme, it inherit the abstraction means
    of Scheme, namely lambda expression with the define.

Here we denote the result of connecting several constraints as /network/. As
example, the network of the conversion of temperatures given as [[file:image/3_28.gif][Figure 3.28]]. To
deduce the cloudy objects in our computational world in terms of state and
references, we need to extract more information from the informal behavior of
simple examples. Let we inspect the above figure a little more specifically. The
conversion constraint network consists of primitive adder, multiplier, and
constant constraints. For that, please see the relevant discussion in the text
book.

The important concept is not the description of the behavior but how they
deduced that description. Our task is to trace back that process to apply our
own application in later. They nicely captured the common behavior of two
examples -- mechanic law of material and conversion of temperatures -- into
networks of primitive elements -- constant, multiplier, and adder boxes. Then
as they simulation in their mind, they filled the details of the
requirement. All of these made by wishful thinking: They believe that the
real world system, such as mechanical system, can be mapped into our
computational world even though we only know rough behavior of real world
behavior.

With all the specification in the text book, we can deduce the cloudy objects
as connector should have state variable that holds the value of connector and
constraint list of all constraints to which the connector linked; in
addition, it should have informant as its state variable to achieve the
requirement. For the primitive constraint boxes, it should have references to
terminals to poll and set; it should possess identity to signature informant
part of the connector. It forms the cloudy objects.

*** To deduce the concrete environment diagram,
here we use test usages to make things more concretely.

So far, we developed the skeletons of our language, here we will develop more
concrete contents by specifying how we want to use the constraint system. The
temperature constraint network converted to
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define C (make-connector))
(define F (make-connector))
(celsius-fahrenheiit-converter C F)
#+END_SRC

The real works defined as
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (celsius-farenheit-converter c f)
  (let ((u (make-connector))
        (v (make-connector))
        (w (make-connector))
        (x (make-connector))
        (y (make-connector)))
    (multiplier c w u)
    (multiplier v x u)
    (adder v y f)
    (constant 9 w)
    (constant 5 x)
    (constant 32 y)
    'ok))
#+END_SRC

As we did in digital circuit simulation, to see what is going on, we probe on
the connector that we want to know the value when it changed. It should work
as follows
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(probe "Celsius temp" C)
(probe "Fahrenheit temp" F)

(set-value! C 25 'user)
Probe : Celsius temp = 25
Probe : Fahrenheit temp = 77
done
#+END_SRC

If we try to set =F= to a new value, say 212 it should behave as
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-value! F 212 'user)
Error! Contradiction (77 212)
#+END_SRC

That is, the connector complains that it has sensed a contradiction: Its
value is 77, and someone is trying to set it to 212. If we really want to
reuse the network with new values, we should tell =C= to forget its old value
before setting to new value:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(forget-value! C 'user)
Probe: Celsius temp = ?
Probe: Fahrenheit temp = ?
done
#+END_SRC

=C= finds that the =user=, who set its value originally, is now retracting
that value, so =C= agrees to lose its value, as shown by the probe, and
informs the rest of the network of this fact. This information eventually
propagates to =F=, which now finds that it has no reason for continuing to
believe that its own value is 77. Thus, =F= also gives up its value, as shown
by the probe.

Now that =F= has no value, we can safely set it to 212:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-value! F 212 'user)
Probe: Fahrenheit temp = 212
Probe: Celsius temp = 100
done
#+END_SRC

*** Unfortunately, what we deduced from the lecture 5B was wrong!
You should notice something wrong is happening around the previous section or
process. What we tried to deduce is not just the environment diagram.
Environment diagram is not dynamic -- it is static as its nature; but what we
tried to capture is dynamic thing -- it evolves as time passes.

We can only convert the general pattern of the moment of object not the whole
behavior of particular object, that is the evolution of process, as we capture
the computation pattern using the substitution model.

To design the behavior of objects we need to consult our old method, wishful
thinking in terms of ADT or the core features that a powerful language should
have with the method of designing algorithm.

In fact it is not the unfortunate thing, as we have practiced enough to design
our own ADT (and algorithm) again and again so far. The only difference is that
now we have to consider the moment of evolution and capture that moment using
environment model; in the substitution model, we does not considered the moment
of evolution as there is no time in it. To summarize our abstract process of
designing what we want is unchanged but the tools have changed.

*** Implementing the constraint system
So far, we converted the behavior of sample objects into that of our
computational world. Now we turn our topic into implementing the primitive
constraints using the ADT of connector by wishful thinking as we did again and
again, that is we haven't got the resulting code of connector, that is, we
just "assume" we have one.

Here is the specifications for the operations on connectors:
- =(has-value? <connector>)=
  tells whether the connector has a value.
- =(get-value <connector>)=
  returns the connector's current value.
- =(set-value! <connector> <new-value> <informant>)=
  indicates that the informant is requesting the connector to set its value to
  the new value.
- =(forget-value! <connector> <retractor>)=
  tells the connector that the retractor is requesting it to forget its value.
- =(connect <connector> <new-constraint>)=
  tells the connector to participate in the new constraint.


The connectors communicate with the constraints by means of the procedures
=inform-about-value=, which tells the given constraint that the connector has a
value, and =inform-about-no-value=, which tells the constraint that the
connector has lost its value.

Note that by using the wishful thinking we could break down the massive
structure into smaller ones as we did in the [[org:../MEGAsync/MIT Challenge/6.001/Chapter2.org][Exercise 2.92]]. From this process,
we can learn how to expand our previous designing skill embracing mutation. The
only difference is that in previous we used to substitution model in conversion
from common computation to code, here we use environment model to convert the
picture of object at some moment to code.

Back to our discourse, =adder= constructs an adder constraint among summand
connectors =a1= and =a2= and a =sum= connector. To implement this object, we
think each part composing the whole object separately:
- To capture the state mutation, and references relations using the environment model,
- to capture the evolutions using procedure as we did before in the functional programming.

The behavior of our newly defined primitive constraints are similar of the
primitive function boxes of digital circuit but this constraint has to have
identity. That means it should be the procedure with the local state -- object
in message passing style.

Using those observations we can produce code that do the right things:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (adder a1 a2 sum)
  (define (process-new-value)
    (cond ((and (has-value? a1) (has-value? a2))
           (set-value! sum
                       (+ (get-value a1) (get-value a2))
                       me))
          ((and (has-value? a1) (has-value? sum))
           (set-value! a2
                       (- (get-value sum) (get-value a1))
                       me))
          ((and (has-value? a2) (has-value? sum))
           (set-value! a1
                       (- (get-value sum) (get-value a2))
                       me))))
  (define (process-forget-value)
    (forget-value! sum me)
    (forget-value! a1 me)
    (forget-value! a2 me)
    (process-new-value))
  (define (me request)
    (cond ((eq? request 'I-have-a-value)
           (process-new-value))
          ((eq? request 'I-lost-my-value)
           (process-forget-value))
          (else
           (error "Unknown request -- ADDER" request))))
  (connect a1 me)
  (connect a2 me)
  (connect sum me)
  me)
#+END_SRC

The following "syntax interfaces" are used in conjunction with the dispatch:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (inform-about-value constraint)
  (constraint 'I-have-a-value))
(define (inform-about-no-value constraint)
  (constraint 'I-lost-my-value))
#+END_SRC

The adder's local procedure =processs-new-value= is called when the adder is
informed that one of its connectors has a value. It evolves as what the behavior
does. The only non-trivial process is the =process-forget-value= it works if the
adder is told that one of its connectors has lost a value, it requests that all
of its connectors now lose their value as desired but now it runs
=process-new-value=. In =adder=, we could not grasp the essence why it needs to
be done like that but it becomes somewhat more apparently when we consider the
=multiplier= constraint:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (multiplier m1 m2 product)
  (define (process-new-value)
    (cond ((or (and (has-value? m1) (= (get-value m1) 0))
               (and (has-value? m2) (= (get-value m2) 0)))
           (set-value! product 0 me))
          ((and (has-value? m1) (has-value? m2))
           (set-value! product
                       (* (get-value m1) (get-value m2))
                       me))
          ((and (has-value? product) (has-value? m1))
           (set-value m2
                      (/ (get-value product) (get-value m1))
                      me))
          ((and (has-value? product) (has-value? m2))
           (set-value m1
                      (/ (get-value product) (get-value m2))
                      me))))
  (define (process-forget-value)
    (forget-value! product me)
    (forget-value! m1 me)
    (forget-value! m2 me)
    (process-new-value))
  (define (me request)
    (cond ((eq? request 'I-have-a-value)
           (process-new-value))
          ((eq? request 'I-lost-my-value)
           (process-forget-value))
          (else
           (error "Unknown request -- MULTIPLIER" request))))
  (connect m1 me)
  (connect m2 me)
  (connect product me)
  me)
#+END_SRC

Think about the situation where =m1= equals to 0 and also =m2= equals to 0
changed to =m2= got changed its value to not 0; =sum= still have to hold 0 as
one of the multiplicand is 0. This is why we need to run =process-new-value= at
the end of =process-forget-value=. So, for the =adder= case, we think this
additional complexity is for consistency through whole system.

For the other primitives, please refer the contents of text book.
*** Representing connector
As we outlined above, connector is represented in our computational world as a
procedural object with local state variables =value=, the current value of the
connector; =informant=, the object that set the connector's value; and
=constraints=, a list of the constraints in which the connector participates.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

*** Exercise 3.37
Using the expression-oriented style of definition, we can rewrite the
=celsius-fahrenheit-converter= procedure as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (celsius-fahrenheit-converter x)

          x)

#+END_SRC

Here =c+=, =c*=, etc. are the "constraint" versions of the arithmetic
operations. For example, =c+= takes two connectors as arguments and returns a
connector that is related to these by an adder constraint:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (c+ x y)
  (let ((z (make-connector)))
    (adder x y z)
    z))
#+END_SRC

Then, we can define =c-=, =c*=, =c/=, and =cv= (constant value) analogous to
=c+=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (c- s x)
  (let ((y (make-connector)))
    (adder x y s)
    y))

(define (c* x y)
  (let ((z (make-connector)))

* Concurrency: Time Is of the Essence
** The Nature of Time in Concurrent Systems
*** Exercise 3.38 **** a.
Note that as Peter \to Paul results in same as Paul \to Peter, There are only
four of cases that differs each other:
- M \to P \to P -- $40;
- Peter \to M \to Paul -- $35;
- Paul \to M \to Peter -- $50;
- P \to P \to M -- $45;


Here we abbreviated Marry as M, Peter or Paul as P when it doesn't matter
whether Peter or Paul.
**** b.
Note that the timing of the accessing the shared variable & mutating that only
matters here. For simplicity (and for the discussion), we only consider the
situation where mutation can not occur at the very same time -- if we allow
this, then the discussion would be bogged down to bit mutation level. Then our
concurrent process can be grouped as
- the three people accessing the same value (at the same timing) of the shared
  variable (the three people try to mutate the shared variable concurrently);
- two of them accessing the same value (at the same timing) of the shared
  variable (two of them try to mutate concurrently);
- each of them accessing the shared variable without interleaving with others
  (the *a.* cases).


If we draw diagram relating these concurrent process, the first case of outlined
above equivalent to only one person of them participate to the mutation, the
second is two of them participate, and the last one participate all of them. As
consequence the number of different situation here is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12. That is,
- first case ::
  - Peter: $110
  - Paul: $80
  - Marry: $50
- second case ::
  - P \to P: $90
  - M \to Peter: $60
  - M \to Paul: $30
  - Paul \to M: $40
  - Peter \to M: $55
- last case (*a.*) ::
  - M \to P \to P -- +$40+;
  - Peter \to M \to Paul -- $35;
  - Paul \to M \to Peter -- +$50+;
  - P \to P \to M -- $45;


Here we stroke out the duplicated result; overall number of different result is 10.
** Mechanisms for Controlling Concurrency
There are several strategy to control the concurrency. In the text book, they
implemented /serializer/, which works as station where issues permission to
operate. Then each of procedure who can mutate shared variable should be
registered by the same serializer to prevent the interleaving process. We can
implement this behavior following the steps of [[Propagation of Constrains][previous section]].

There are several implementation details that we can choose for our own:
- Serializer should have state variable that stores all the procedures that
  registered to self? Actually the way of text book's have chosen reverse way --
  the procedures have to reference the serializer to be controlled.
- How the serializer permit specific procedure to run? We could have done this
  using the massage-passing paradigm:
  #+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :exports results :file ./image/chap3_1.png
actor User
participant "serialized-proc1"
participant serializer
User --> "serialized-proc1": Use!
"serialized-proc1" -> serializer: request permission
serializer -> "serialized-proc1": permit
"serialized-proc1" --> User: result
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:./image/chap3_1.png]]

  However it is not the way of the book's; they make the serializer
  "busy-waiting". If we implement this asynchronous way, we can make our
  serializing scheme more efficient. But, here we only consider what way the
  book driving for the simplicity.
*** Exercise 3.39
Since =s=, now control only one of two execution, not the all of them, and the
controlled procedure never executed twice that are concurrently; thus the
serializer does not work in this situation -- make no difference at all from the
previous unserialized version. Consequently remain all of the previous cases.
*** Exercise 3.40
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
                  (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
#+END_SRC
We can capture above situation abstractly:
- access x_{1} \to access x_{2} \to set x_{3} to (* x_{1} x_{2}); let we
  abbreviate this sequence of events as (x, y, z).
- access x^{1} \to access x^{2} \to access x^{3} \to set x^{4} to (* x^{1} x^{2}
  x^{3}); let we abbreviate this sequence of events as (a, b, c, d)


We used subscriptions or superscriptions to capture the times to access the
variable =x=. Then the resulting sequence of execution should be an sequence
that contains all of the elements of above sequences -- x, y, z, a, b, c, d in
some order with constraints that elements of each sequence should be preserve
the relative order. And note that only mutation (assignment) make the context
different; that is, the number of cases that possibly produce different result
are the number of ways of organizing (0, 0, 0) with 1 plus (1, 1, 1, 1) with 0
minus 2 (duplicated cases among those -- (1, 0) and (0, 1)) -- 7 cases:
- (0, 0, 0, 1): 10^{6}
- (0, 0, 1, 0): 10^{2}
- (0, 1, 0, 0): 10^{4}
- (1, 0, 0, 0): +10^{6}+
- (1, 1, 1, 0, 1): 10^{3}
- (1, 1, 0, 1, 1): +10^{4}+
- (1, 0, 1, 1, 1): 10^{5}


We represented the (x, y, z) sequence as (0, 0, 0) similarly (1, 1, 1, 1) for
(a, b, c, d); so the last element of each sequence represent the assignment
statement. Also in the combined sequences, we only noted one element of other
sequence such as (0, 0, 0, 1) -- here 1 represent the assignment of latter
sequence. -- as only assignment make context different.

If we use the serializer here, the only two case survives -- (0, 1) and (1, 0)
both results to 10^{6}.
*** Exercise 3.41
The Ben Bitdiddle's observation is not correct: As the balance method only
access to the shared state variable not mutating it, this method calling could
not make any different context (can not alter the environment) at all; recall
that the anomalous behavior we concerned here is the interleaving processes
which do access the shared variable and based on that, mutate that variable.
*** Exercise 3.42
To answer this question, we need to inspect the behavior of serializer more
formally. If we interpret the informal specification described in the text book
as only one of evaluation can be processed among the set of procedures
associated with that serializer, then the modification made by Ben Bitdiddle
results to the same behavior as previous one.

On the other hand, if it means only one of procedure, whose instance gets
permission from the serializer, allowed to be executed, then it results in the
instances (processes) of that procedure allowed to be processed concurrently.
That causes the chaos in the banking system cause it will allow interleaving
processes.

So it is good convention to define the banking account procedure as original one
since it does not depend on the interpretation of the specification, which is
the implementation details.
*** Exercise 3.43
As it is evaluated sequentially, all we need to show is that if before
sequential execution specific condition holds, then after which it still holds.
And this assertion can be proved as choose arbitrary one of the execution of
element of sequence; then prove if the a specific condition holds before that
execution, it still holds after that.

By setting the specific condition as the account balances should be $10, $20,
and $30 after the sequential execution, we got what we want.

This condition can be violated allowing the interleaving exchange. I've drawn
the figure describing this situation in the digital paper.

Now we try to prove even this situation, the total balance of accounts are
conserved. Basically, the structure of our proof is same as outlined above. We
decompose the goal into about the each exchange execution, and then into the
individual execution of =withdraw= or =deposit=. About the decomposed goal, we
have the lemma-like specification in the book, so if we formalize that
observation, we are done -- completion of proof. To prove the final decomposed
goal, we need to incorporate the user -- the caller of =exchange= -- to interact
or possess the balance -- difference.

For the last request, I've drawn diagram in the digital paper.
*** Exercise 3.44
As we noted in [[Exercise 3.42][exercise 3.42]], the anomalous behavior can be introduced only by
consequent access to value & mutating that variable. In the previous exchange
procedure, we accessed each account to calculate the difference of those
balances then mutated each account appropriately. That is, the anomaly involved each
account as shared variable. Whereas in our situation, we do not access the
values to mutate the account; in other word our mutation does not depend on the
shared variable. So our execution sequence does not satisfy the condition of
anomalous behavior.
*** Exercise 3.45
Ben Bitdiddle's introduces not halting process -- due to the so called
"deadlock": Our serialized exchange process locks the serializer until it
terminates all of the statement of its body; however the withdrawal (or deposit)
process also require the permission of the same serializer otherwise it can not
proceed, which would be free after that withdrawal (or deposit) process
terminate. This situation end up with interlocked process, does not terminate at all.
*** Exercise 3.46
I've drawn required in my digital paper.
*** Exercise 3.47
**** a.
To implement the semaphore using the mutex, here we modify the definition of
mutex not to make the caller of =acquire= method of that to busy wait.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; modifed mutex -- to fit in the semaphore
(define (make-mutex)
  (let ((cell (list false)))
    (define (the-mutex m)
      (case m
        ((acquire) (test-and-set! cell))
        ((release) (clear! cell))))
    the-mutex))
(define (clear! cell)
  (set-car! cell false))
(define (test-and-set! cell)
  (without-interrupts
   (lambda ()
     (if (car cell)
         true
         (begin (set-car! cell true)
                false)))))
#+END_SRC

Then the previous =make-serializer= can be implemented as
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-serializer)
  (let ((mutex (make-mutex)))
    (lambda (p)
      (define (serialized-p . args)
        (if (mutex 'acquire)
            (mutex 'acquire))           ;retry
        (let ((val (apply p args)))
          (mutex 'release)
          val))
      serialized-p)))
#+END_SRC

Armed with this modified mutex, we can implement semaphore:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-semaphore n)
  (define (make-mutex-chain n)
    (if (zero? n)
        '()
        (cons (make-mutex)
              (make-mutex-chain (-1+ n)))))
  (let ((mutexes (make-cycle (make-mutex-chain n))))
    (define (the-semaphore request)
      (case request
        ((acquire)
         (let loop ((current-cycle mutexes))
           (let ((mutex (car current-cycle)))
             (if (mutex 'acquire)
                 (loop (cdr current-cycle))
                 mutex))))
        (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-SEMAPHORE" request))))
    the-semaphore))
#+END_SRC

Then the serializer with n concurrent procedure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-semaphore n)
  (define (make-mutex-chain n)
    (if (zero? n)
        '()
        (cons (make-mutex)
              (make-mutex-chain (-1+ n)))))
  (let ((mutexes (make-cycle (make-mutex-chain n))))
    (define (the-semaphore request)
      (case request
        ((acquire)
         (let loop ((current-cycle mutexes))
           (let ((mutex (car current-cycle)))
             (if (mutex 'acquire)
                 (loop (cdr current-cycle))
                 mutex))))
        (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-SEMAPHORE" request))))
    the-semaphore))
#+END_SRC
**** b.
 With atomic =test-and-set!= it becomes more concise -- the semaphore only need
 to keep track the number of current concurrent procedures:
 #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-semaphore2 n)
  (let ((cell (list 0)))
    (define (test-and-set!)
      (without-interrupts
       (lambda ()
         (if (< (car cell) n)
             (begin (set-car! cell (1+ (car cell)))
                    false)
             true))))
    (define (clear!)
      (without-interrupts
       (lambda ()
         (set-car! cell (-1+ (car cell))))))
    (define (the-semaphore request)
      (case request
        ((acquire)
         (test-and-set!))
        ((release)
         (clear!))
        (else
         (error "Unknown reuqest -- MAKE-SEMAPHORE2" request))))
    the-semaphore))

(define (make-serializer-with2 n)
  (let ((the-semaphore (make-semaphore2 n)))
    (lambda (p)
      (define (serialized-p . args)
        (if (the-semaphore 'acquire)
            (the-semaphore 'acquire))
        (let ((val (apply p args)))
          (the-semaphore 'release)
          val))
      serialized-p)))
 #+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.48
As noted in the text, deadlock occur in the situation where each process needs
to get permission of every permission from specified serializer set to execute,
but each permission doesn't have to be acquired in specific order. Thus several
process can get some number of permissions concurrently, which leads interlocked
processes.

The given deadlock-avoidance method constrain each process needs to get
permission in specific order; that means the interlocked situation can not occur
at all since to occur such situation, one should break the ordering constraint.

To implement this idea, first we need to modify =make-account-and-serializer= to
issue identification number to each account:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define make-account-and-serializer
  (let ((id 0))
    (lambda (balance)
      (let ((id (begin (set! id (1+ id))
                       id)))
        (define (withdraw amount)
          (if (>= balance amount)
              (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
                     balance)
              "Insufficient funds"))
        (define (deposit amount)
          (set! balance (+ balance amount))
          balance)
        (let ((balance-serializer (make-serializer)))
          (define (dispatch m)
            (case m
              ((withdraw) withdraw)
              ((deposit) deposit)
              ((balance) balance)
              ((serializer) balance-serializer)
              ((id) id)
              (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
          dispatch)))))
#+END_SRC

Then test the id feature:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define a (make-account-and-serializer 100))
(define b (make-account-and-serializer 100))
(a 'id)
;Value: 1

(b 'id)
;Value: 2
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (serialized-exchange account1 account2)
  (let ((id1 (account1 'id))
        (id2 (account2 'id))
        (serializer1 (account1 'serializer))
        (serializer2 (account2 'serializer)))
    (if (< id1 id2)
        ((serializer1 (serializer2 exchange))
         account1
         account2)
        ((serializer2 (serializer1 exchange))
         account2
         account1))))
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.49
Such scenario should satisfy the selection of the other account depends on the
value of the shared resource of first account and also it should mutate the
depending resource in that process.

We can think of the joint account situation a bit screwed from what discussed in
the text book -- jointing accounts results to making each account reference the
other account in their state variable. Then now think of the situation where we
want to exchange the account's balance of ones with the joint account's. It
cannot be avoided by outlined procedure in [[Exercise 3.48][exercise 3.48]].
*** Concurrency, time, and communication
Let we conclude this section quoting the last paragraph of the text's this
section:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The basic phenomenon here is that synchronizing different processes,
establishing shared state, or imposing an order on events requires communication
among the processes. In essence, any notion of time in concurrency control must
be intimately tied to communication. It is intriguing that a similar connection
between time and communication also arises in the Theory of Relativity, where
the speed of light (the fastest signal that can be used to synchronize events)
is a fundamental constant relating time and space. The complexities we encounter
in dealing with time and state in our computational models may in fact mirror a
fundamental complexity of the physical universe.
#+END_QUOTE
* Streams
Here we approach the modeling of real world in different angle: We try to
capture time as sequence of instants; that is analogous to the physical
interpretation of world as 4 dimension -- time axis with 3D space.

With this view point, we can use our sequence processing interface to process
the streams. In fact, this stream processing is powerful model which enables us
to deal the state without ever using assignment or mutable data.

On the other hand, the stream framework raises difficulties of its own, and the
question of which modeling technique leads to more modular and more easily
maintained systems remains open.
** Streams Are Delayed Lists

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

       (apply proc (map stream-car argstreams))
       (apply stream-map

For the latter question: Yes it'll produce different result, since it now the
duplicated evaluation aggregate the value of sum by the computation result of
that additional evaluation.
** Infinite Streams
The important aspect of streams that differs from previous processes --
iterative, recursive -- is that streams unfolds the specified process while the
others folding the given argument; that is, streams make more complex things as
it evolves, whereas the others simplifying those.

Observe that procedure dealing with streams usually capture the differential
equation as we'll learn from 6.01.
*** Exercise 3.53
This stream captures the differential equation given by
\begin{matrix}
s[n] =& s[n-1] + s[n-1] =& 2s[n-1]\\
s[0] =& 0
\end{matrix}

So, by solving the deduced equation, we got $s[n] = 2^{n}$.
*** Exercise 3.54
The differential equation we want:
\begin{matrix}
f[n] =& f[n-1] \times int[n + 1]\\
f[0] =& 1
\end{matrix}

The converted code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (mul-streams s1 s2)
  (stream-map * s1 s2))

(define factorials (cons-stream 1 (mul-streams (integers-starting-from 2)
                                               factorials)))
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.55
The differential equation we want:
\begin{matrix}
f[n] =& f[n-1] + s[n]\\
f[0] =& s[0]
\end{matrix}

Then the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (partial-sums s)
  (define partials
    (cons-stream (stream-car s)
                 (add-streams (stream-cdr s) partials)))

*** Exercise 3.57
We answers to the questions in order:
1. The number of additions results to $n-2$ since
   - base case: 3th =fibs= needs one addition.
   - inductive case: nth =fibs= needs # of additions of n-1th =fibs= + 1.
2. The number of the latter would be greater than 2^{n/2 - 1} since
   - \[T(3) = 1\]
   - \[T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + 1\]
   These equation can be deduced as it does not involve any assignment
   explicitly & implicitly; so the evaluation does not depends on context, that
   is to the result of $T(n-2)$ after evaluating $T(n-1)$ same as $T(n-2)$
   before evaluating $T(n-1)$.
*** Exercise 3.58

**** a.
The code do the right things:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (integrate-series s)
  (stream-map (lambda (s i) (/ s i)) s integers))
#+END_SRC

And test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

**** b.
Here we using following observation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(cons-stream (stream-car series), (integrate-series (deriv series))) = series
#+END_SRC

So, the answers can be implemented as

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define cosine-series
  (cons-stream 1 (integrate-series (stream-map - sine-series))))

(define sine-series
  (cons-stream 0 (integrate-series cosine-series)))
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.60
Let S_{2} be $\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots\}$ then =(mul-series S1 S2)= should equals
to $a_{0} S_{1} + x S_{1} \times \{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots\}$.

From above observation, we can deduce
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(mul-series s1 s2)
= (add-series (scale-stream s1 (stream-car s2))
                                 (shift (mul-series s1 (stream-cdr s2))))
= (let ((a0s1 (scale-stream s1 (stream-car s2))))
    (cons-stream
     (stream-car a0s1)
     (add-series (stream-cdr a0s1)
                 (mul-series s1 (stream-cdr s2)))))
#+END_SRC

Then the result:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (mul-series s1 s2)
  (let ((a0s1 (scale-stream s1 (stream-car s2))))
    (cons-stream
     (stream-car a0s1)
     (add-series (stream-cdr a0s1)
                 (mul-series s1 (stream-cdr s2))))))
#+END_SRC

Then test:

#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 3.61
The straight forward implementation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (invert-unit-series s)
  (define X (cons-stream
             (stream-car s)
             (mul-series
              (stream-cdr s)
              (stream-map - X))))
  X)
#+END_SRC

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define test-invert-series
  (invert-unit-series test-integrate-series))
test-invert-series

;Value: {1 -1/2 -1/12 -1/24 -19/720 -3/160 -863/60480 -275/24192 -33953/3628800 -8183/1036800 -3250433/479001600 ...}
#+END_SRC

The problem is I don't know the result of the test case is right. Let this test
delegate to next exercise.
*** Exercise 3.62
Here we use following observation:
\begin{align*}
&\{n_{0}, n_{1}, \ldots\} / \{d_{0}, d_{1}, \ldots\}\\
=&\frac{\{n_{0}, n_{1}, \ldots\}/d_{0}}{\{1, d_{1}/d_{0}, d_{2}/d_{0}, \ldots\}}
\end{align*}
It results into
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (div-series ns ds)
  (let ((d0 (stream-car ds)))
    (cond ((zero? d0)
           (error "Zero division -- DIV-SERIES" ds))
          (else
           (let ((ns/d0 (stream-map (lambda (n) (/ n d0)) ns))
                 (ds/d0 (stream-map (lambda (d) (/ d d0)) ds)))
             (mul-series
              ns/d0
              (invert-unit-series ds/d0)))))))
#+END_SRC

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define test-div-series
  (div-series sine-series sine-series))
;Zero division -- DIV-SERIES {0 1 0 -1/6 0 ...}
(define test-div-series

** Exploiting the Stream Paradigm
*** Exercise 3.63
The modified version need to recalculate the subsequent call of =(sqrt-stream
x)= within the body of =sqrt-stream= whereas the original one just refer the
precalculated result.

If we just use call-by-name not call-by-need, the two different version of these
procedure would hardly differ each other since both should recalculate recursive
call of expression.

I've deduced this result using environment diagram. You should also draw by
yourself.
