#+TITLE: Computing with Register Machines
So far we have learned the meanings of procedures using a succession of models
of evaluation: The substitution model, the environment model, the metacircular
evaluator. But none of these evaluation model did not dispel how the evaluation
of subexpression manages to return a value to the expression that uses this
value, nor does the evaluator explain how some recursive procedures generate
iterative processes.

In this chapter we are going to learn so called "linking" process, which link
the callee and caller with the returning value.

Further more, as it is the last chapter of this text book, this chapter
organized as the canonical structure in that we've learned so far: By wishful
thinking,
1. Design or specify what we want to implement or the behavior that we want from
   the application -- section 5.1;
2. implement the high level procedures using the low level procedure's
   specifications, by wishful thinking -- we haven't yet implemented the low
   level procedure but we can specify what we want from the perspective of high
   level procedure implementor --, section 5.2;
3. then we implement the very low procedures using only the primitives --
   section 5.3;
4. a variation or application of what we implemented -- section 5.4;
5. deep dive what we have assumed as primitive or "as given" -- section 5.5;


So by learning through this chapter, we can learn not just the contents it
contains but also the general strategy to embody the ideas into the real world
program. This general strategy would be applied to any of design process one
would encounter with when try to create something that isn't yet in the world
that solves the given specific kind of problem.

We'd better to be engraved in our mind the general strategy through out this chapter.

* Designing Register Machines
*** Exercise 5.1
I've drawn this with my digital paper. But you should be careful that our switch
is not just simple switch, which we probably used in electrical experiment in
middle or like that age, but a switch that has memorizing feature so that one
can clobber the contents of given register.

So we can use the result signal or value of operator -- multiply, addition, etc.
-- to clobber the operand register directly without intervening the
intermediate register.

It is not deducible from the contents before this exercise, that is, from the
=gcd= machine; but we can do from the later example machines. It is quite unfair
they did not specify what feature the switches possesses exactly -- only in a
context that even not appear until this exercise.

** A Language for Describing Register Machines
So far our language for the design of machines was diagrams -- one for data
paths and one for controller; now through this chapter we extends our tools for
designing register machines to more powerful programming like language that we
can simulate easily by restricting the freedom of design -- only the finite
number of instructions can be used in the designing.

*** Exercise 5.2
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(controller
    (assign p (const 1))
    (assign c (const 1))
 test-c
    (test (op >) (reg c) (reg n))
    (branch (label fact-done))
    (assign p (op *) (reg p) (reg c))
    (assign c (op +) (reg c) (const 1))
    (goto (label test-c))
 fact-done)
#+END_SRC
** Abstraction in Machine Design
*** Exercise 5.3
The first version that assume the internal definitions are available as
primitive procedure in the =sqrt-iter=.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(controller
    (assign g (const 1.0))
 test-g
    (test (op g-e?) (reg g))
    (branch (label sqrt-done))
    (assign g (op imp) (reg g))
    (goto (label test-g))
 sqrt-done)
#+END_SRC

Note that we haven't even mentioned the =x= in above controller description.

Now we are going to implement the second task -- unwind the internal definitions
into the primitive ones.

** Instruction Summary
In this section, the specifications we need to implement are summarized.
* A Register-Machine Simulator
Now we implement or learn what they implemented step by step for the
specifications of preceding design. Here they implement through by using wishful
thinking as we outlined in the beginning of this chapter.
*** Exercise 5.7

** The Machine Model
This subsection implements the middle-high level procedures.
** The Assembler
The assembler is like the analyzer in section 4.1.7. It transforms the text
instructions (expressions) into execution procedures. The idea behind this
process is much of the works the simulator would do otherwise can be processed
without knowing the actual contents of machine registers. For example, they
replaced the references to registers by pointers to the register objects -- as
we did in the last exercise in the [[org:../MEGAsync/MIT Challenge/6.001/Chapter4.org][previous chapter]], and replace references to
labels by pointers to the place in the instruction sequence that the label
designates -- like the variable bound to pair actually bound to pointer to that
pair.

*** Exercise 5.8
Since we construct the label entries from the very end to the start point (using
continuation), when we =lookup-label= with label =here=, the first label =here=
in the controller text returned by the contract of =assoc=.

So =a= would be 3 when it reaches =there=.

To modify this behavior as specified in the statement, we need to construct ADT
barrier for adding the newly constructed label entry to the given labels.

Specifically it should =lookup-label= to check whether the given =label-name= is
already in the labels; if it is, signal error.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (add-label-entry entry labels)
  (if (get-label labels (label-name entry))
      (error "Given label name already exists in the labels" (list entry labels))
      (cons entry labels)))

(define (label-name entry) (car entry))

(define (get-label labels label-name)
  (let ((val (assoc label-name labels)))
    (if val
        (cdr val)
        false)))
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (extract-labels text receive)
  (if (null? text)
      (receive '() '())
      (extract-labels (cdr text)
       (lambda (insts labels)
         (let ((next-inst (car text)))
           (if (symbol? next-inst)
               (receive insts (add-label-entry
                               (make-label-entry next-inst
                                                 insts)
                               labels))
               (receive (cons (make-instruction next-inst)
                              insts)
                        labels)))))))
#+END_SRC

And we can test this feature:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define test-5.8-machine
  (make-machine
   '(a)
   '()
   '(start
     (goto (label here))
     here
     (assign a (const 3))
     (goto (label there))
     here
     (assign a (const 4))
     (goto (label there))
     there)
   ))

;Given label name already exists in the labels ((here ((assign a (const 3))) ((goto (label there))) . #0=(((assign a (const 4))) ((goto (label there))))) ((here . #0#) (there)))
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC
** Generating Execution Procedures for Instructions
=Assemble= procedure uses =make-execution-procedure=. This is has many analogy
with =analyze= procedure in section 4.1.7; these uses dispatch on data type, and
produce execution procedure that is analyzed using informations other than
actual contents.

*** Exercise 5.9
We can use either of following strategies:
- Define the procedure analogous to =make-primitive-exp=; or
- filter the label expression before calling the =make-primitive-exp=.


Here we are going to use the latter since it elicit what we meant more
specifically than the former.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-operation-exp exp machine labels operations)
  (let ((op (lookup-prim (operation-exp-op exp) operations))
        (aprocs
         (map (lambda (e)
                (if (label-exp? e)
                    (error "Operation can not operate on label expression" e))
                (make-primitive-exp e machine labels))
              (operation-exp-operands exp))))
    (lambda ()
      (apply op (map (lambda (p) (p)) aprocs)))))
#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 5.10
We can do that other than the instructions should have type notation in its
=car= part since =make-execution-procedure= depends on this fact directly. For the
rest we are good to modify whatever we like since there are no restriction at all.

It means we should fence around dispatch on data type in the =make-execution-procedure=.

But for now let we stick what granted for us.

What we requested is not to create new syntax that has new semantic per se but
change one of the existing syntax to new one. We could change the register
syntax as post-fix notation like =(n reg)= by modifying as
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (register-exp? exp)
  (and (pair? exp)
       (pair? (cdr exp))
       (eq? (cadr exp) 'reg)))

(define (register-exp-reg exp) (car exp))
#+END_SRC

Then it works as expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define expt-iter-machine
  (make-machine
   '(n b c p)
   `((= ,=) (- ,-) (* ,*))
   '(
     (assign c (n reg))
     (assign p (const 1))
     expt-loop
     (test (op =) (c reg) (const 0))
     (branch (label expt-done))
     (assign c (op -) (c reg) (const 1))
     (assign p (op *) (b reg) (p reg))
     (goto (label expt-loop))
     expt-done)))

*** Exercise 5.11
First let us code the test machine:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define test-5.11-machine
  (make-machine
   '(x y)
   '()
   '((save y)
     (save x)
     (restore y))))
#+END_SRC
**** a.
We can reduce the following two lines
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in Fibonacci controller
    (assign n (reg val))                ;n now contains Fib(n - 2)
    (restore val)                       ;val now contains Fib(n - 1)
#+END_SRC
into one line:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (restore n)                         ;n now contains Fib(n - 1)
#+END_SRC
**** b.
Now =save= has to construct new data structure that associate value with the
name of register. For now let's just use pair for to do this work:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-save inst machine stack pc)
  (let ((reg-name (stack-inst-reg-name inst)))
    (let ((reg (get-register machine reg-name)))
      (lambda ()

        (advance-pc pc)))))

(define (make-restore inst machine stack pc)

            (error "Tried to restore value from register which is not one saved -- MAKE-RESTORE"))
        (advance-pc pc)))))
#+END_SRC

And test:

;Tried to restore value from register which is not one saved -- MAKE-RESTORE
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

**** c.
Whenever =allocate-register= to machine it should also add new stack to the
stacks -- =Alist<reg-name x stack>=; then =save= & =restore= first lookup the
specific stack associated with given register and do usual stack manipulations.

To initialize, it sends =initialize= messages each of stack in stacks.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-new-machine)

        (set-contents! reg (pop stack)))
      (advance-pc pc))))
#+END_SRC

Then test:

Works as expected.
*** Exercise 5.12
- a list of all instructions without duplicates, sorted by instruction type;

  We need to implement constructing procedure that is analogous to
  =merge-weighted= or ordered. We could have chosen to sort the instructions
  in alphabetical order without bothered by the instruction type, but I felt it
  is more canonical to order the result in the order of dispatch on type in
  =make-execution-procedure=.

  Here is one possible solution:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define type-dict
  '((assign 1) (test 2) (branch 3) (goto 4)
    (save 5) (restore 6) (perform 7)))

(define (adjoin-ordered precede? item ordered)
  (if (null? ordered)
      (list item)
      (let ((first (first ordered)))
        (cond ((precede? item first)
               (cons item ordered))
              ((precede? first item)
               (cons first
                     (adjoin-ordered
                      precede? item (cdr ordered))))
              (else
               ;; given item already in the ordered
               ordered)))))

(define (inst-precede? inst1 inst2)
  (let ((type1 (car inst1))
        (type2 (car inst2)))
    (let ((mapped1 (cadr (assoc type1 type-dict)))
          (mapped2 (cadr (assoc type2 type-dict))))
      (cond ((< mapped1 mapped2) true)
            ((> mapped1 mapped2) false)
            (else
             ;; same number
             (not (equal? inst1 inst2)) ;just exclude the same one
             )))))

;; First request
(define (assemble controller-text machine receive)
  (extract-labels controller-text
    (lambda (insts labels)
      (update-insts! insts labels machine)
      (receive
          insts
          (fold-right (lambda (inst ordered)
                        (adjoin-ordered inst-precede? inst ordered))
                      '()
                      (map (lambda (inst) (instruction-text inst))
                           insts))))))
  #+END_SRC

  Here we used the continuation to hand over the updated instructions with the
  newly constructed a list of all instructions:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-machine register-names ops controller-text)
  (let ((machine (make-new-machine)))
    (for-each (lambda (register-name)
                ((machine 'allocate-register) register-name))
              register-names)
    ((machine 'install-operations) ops)
    (assemble controller-text machine
               (lambda (instructions all-instructions)
                 ((machine 'install-instruction-sequence)
                  instructions)
                 ((machine 'install-all-instructions)
                  all-instructions)))
    machine))
  #+END_SRC

  And modify the =make-new-machine= accordingly. Then test with Fibonacci
  machine:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (fib-machine 'all-instructions))
((assign continue (label fib-done))
 (assign continue (label afterfib-n-1))
 (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 1))
 (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 2))
 (assign continue (label afterfib-n-2))
 (assign n (reg val))
 (assign val (op +) (reg val) (reg n))
 (assign val (reg n))
 (test (op <) (reg n) (const 2))
 (branch (label immediate-answer))
 (goto (label fib-loop))
 (goto (reg continue))
 (save continue)
 (save n)
 (save continue)
 (save val)
 (restore n)
 (restore continue)
 (restore val)
 (restore continue))
;Unspecified return value
  #+END_SRC

  Unfortunately, our implementation was wrong! the duplicates appear in the
  result. So we need to arrange in strict order:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (inst-precede? inst1 inst2)
  (let ((type1 (car inst1))
        (type2 (car inst2)))

  #+END_SRC

  For the reminding purpose, we implemented other high order procedure also.
  Then let's re-test
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (fib-machine 'all-instructions))
((assign continue (label afterfib-n-1))
 (assign continue (label afterfib-n-2))
 (assign continue (label fib-done))
 (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 1))
 (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 2))
 (assign n (reg val))
 (assign val (op +) (reg val) (reg n))
 (assign val (reg n))
 (test (op <) (reg n) (const 2))
 (branch (label immediate-answer))
 (goto (label fib-loop))
 (goto (reg continue))
 (save continue)
 (save n)
 (save val)
 (restore continue)
 (restore n)
 (restore val))
;Unspecified return value
  #+END_SRC

  Now it returns what we expected.
- a list (without duplicates) of the registers used to hold entry points (these
  are the registers referenced by =goto= instructions);

  To do this task, we reuse what the result from the previous task. Here is the
  strategy:
  1. Filter the all instructions with =goto-exp?=;

  2. using =map=, extract the =goto-dest= part;

  3. filter that with =register-exp?=;

  4. and lastly, extract the =register-exp-reg= part and that is what we wanted.

    Here is the code do this idea:
    #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  ,*** in assemble
  (let* ((all-insts
          (fold-right (lambda (inst ordered)
                        (adjoin-ordered inst-precede? inst ordered))
                      '()
                      (map (lambda (inst) (instruction-text inst))
                           insts)))
         (entry-regs
          (filter-map
           (lambda (goto-inst)
             (let ((dest (goto-dest goto-inst)))
               (and (register-exp? dest)
                    (register-exp-reg dest))))
           (take-while
            (lambda (inst)
              (eq? (car inst) 'goto))
            (drop-while
             (lambda (inst)
               (not (eq? (car inst) 'goto)))
             all-insts)))))
    (accept
     insts
     all-insts
     entry-regs))
    #+END_SRC

    We've integrate *2.* to *4.* part using =filter-map=; and for the first one,
    we used =take-while= and =drop-while= exploiting the fact that all
    instructions are sorted in types.

    Then test:
    #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (pp (fib-machine 'registers-with-entry))
  (continue)
  ;Unspecified return value
    #+END_SRC
- a list (without duplicates) of the registers that are =save= d or =restore= d;

  This is analogous to the preceding one:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in let expression of assemble
(stack-related-regs
 (map
  (lambda (inst)
    (stack-inst-reg-name inst))
  (take-while
   (lambda (inst)
     (or (eq? (car inst) 'save)
         (eq? (car inst) 'restore)))
   (drop-while
    (lambda (inst)
      (not (eq? (car inst) 'save)))
    all-insts))))
  #+END_SRC

  Then test:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (fib-machine 'stack-instruction-registers))
(continue n val continue n val)
;Unspecified return value
  #+END_SRC

  Huh! It's not what we expected. It is due to that we count one for the =save=
  and one for the =restore=, which usually end up with duplicates names.

  So let's fix it using the =adjoin-ordered=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(stack-related-regs
 (fold-right
  (lambda (reg-name regs)
    (adjoin-ordered
     symbol<?
     reg-name
     regs))
  '()
  (map (lambda (inst)
         (stack-inst-reg-name inst))
       (take-while
        (lambda (inst)
          (or (eq? (car inst) 'save)
              (eq? (car inst) 'restore)))
        (drop-while
         (lambda (inst)
           (not (eq? (car inst) 'save)))
         all-insts)))))
  #+END_SRC

  Then we got
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (fib-machine 'stack-instruction-registers))
(continue n val)
;Unspecified return value
  #+END_SRC

- for each register, a list (without duplicates) of the sources from which it is
  assigned.

  Notice that the register source relations can be deduced directly from the
  =assign= expressions. So here we attempt to solve this task using the
  following strategy:
  1. Assume we have table data structure that has key /values/ entries. That is,
     if one insert key value pair into the given table, the value adjoined into
     the value list of given key.

  2. Then filter out the all instructions into =assign= expressions, and then
     insert the =assign-reg-name= as key and the =assign-value-exp= as value
     into the above table.

  3. The rest is interfacing this with the machine object; one can retrieve the
     sources of given register using the message, =sources-of=.

  Here is the code:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in assemble let expression
(reg-sources-table
 (let ((tbl (make-multivalues-table)))
   (for-each
    (lambda (inst)
      ((tbl 'insert!)
       (assign-reg-name inst)
       (assign-value-exp inst)))
    (take-while
     (lambda (inst)
       (eq? (car inst) 'assign))
     all-insts))
   tbl))
  #+END_SRC

  Then what assumed:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-multivalues-table)
  (let ((local-table '(*table*)))
    (define (lookup-vals key)
      (cond ((assoc key (cdr local-table)) => cdr)
            (else false)))
    (define (insert-value! key value)
      (let ((entry (assoc key (cdr local-table))))
        (if entry
            (set-cdr! entry
                      (cons value (cdr entry)))
            (set-cdr! local-table
                      (cons (cons key (list value))
                            (cdr local-table))))))
    (lambda (m)
      (case m
        ((lookup) lookup-vals)
        ((insert!) insert-value!)
        (else
         (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-MULTIVALUES-TABLE" m))))))

  Then test:

*** Exercise 5.13
We can what we want by modifying =get-register= procedure, which called in the
=make-execution-procedure= to reference the register object allocated in given
machine.

But it is not good idea to alter the existing =get-register= procedure since it
may interface with other process also as its contract is not just for the
=make-execution-procedure=.

So it would be better to make procedure that is analogous to =get-register= but
it allocates given register name whenever it has not been allocated in given
machine. If given register name already allocated in given machine, then it
should works like =get-register=.

With this idea, we can do the task what we requested. After implementing this
idea, we are good to discard the preallocating process in the =make-machine=.

*** Exercise 5.17
Here we should think of what abstraction level we are going to modify. Since the
tracing things is about in the =make-new-machine= procedure, we may need to the
machine object to possess label information.

But we do not want break the ADT about the label data, it would be better to
offer lookup method with the label data from outside of machine object.

And also construct additional ADT:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; ADT for labels package which going to be installed into machine object
(define (make-labels-package find-from-key find-from-val labels)
  (list find-from-key find-from-val labels))
(define (find-from-key-proc labels-pack)
  (car labels-pack))
(define (find-from-val-proc labels-pack)
  (cadr labels-pack))
(define (labels-data labels-pack)
  (caddr labels-pack))

;; operate on labels-package
(define (find-from-val labels-pack)
  (lambda (val)
    ((find-from-val-proc labels-pack)
     val
     (labels-data labels-pack))))

(define (find-from-key labels-pack)
  (lambda (key)
    ((find-from-key-proc labels-pack)
     key
     (labels-data labels-pack))))
#+END_SRC

Then define the retriever:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; selector of labels
(define retrive-label-from-insts
  (association-procedure eq? cdr))
#+END_SRC

The rest is interface with the others:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in assemble
(accept
 insts
 (make-labels-package
  get-label
  retrive-label-from-insts
  labels)

        (if label-entry
            (begin (newline)

Then unit test:

All the rest is to interface in the =make-new-machine=:

#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 5.19
This is a analogous feature to =start= procedure; but use =label= data. The
specifications on the procedures that manipulate break points indicates we need
to define new data structure that keeps track of all the break points.

As we noted before, our machine now has the information about the label as its
state variable, we can transform the specifications of where the break point
should be into the actual instruction. So here we are going to store this
transformed information as the break points data structure -- so called internal
data.

For the break points data structure, we need to remove the specified break point
from the structure; it means we should mutate the data structure. So we'd better
to give the data structure identity. For this purpose, we'll implement the break
points as headed list to possess identity.

And more, we should keep track of the current break point since we should
support the =proceed-machine= procedure. We can exploit dummy head of the headed
list possessing this additional information. Or

Then here is the code
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** as state variable of make-new-machine
        (break-points '(#f))
...
,*** internal defintions of make-new-machine
      (define (cdring-down lst n)
        (if (= n 1)
            lst
            (cdring-down (cdr lst)
                         (-1+ n))))
      (define (add-break-point label n)
        (let ((break-point
               (cdring-down ((find-from-key labels-package) label)
                            n)))
          (if (memq break-point (cdr break-points))
              (error "Given break point already in break points -- ADD-BREAK-POINT"
                     (list label n))
              (set-cdr! break-points (cons break-point
                                           (cdr break-points))))))
      (define (remove-break-point label n)
        (let ((break-point
               (cdring-down ((find-from-key labels-package) label)
                            n)))
          (let loop ((items break-points))
            (cond ((null? (cdr items))
                   (error "Given break point not in break points -- REMOVE-BREAK-POINT"
                          (list label n)))
                  ((eq? (cadr items) break-point)
                   (set-cdr! items (cddr items)))
                  (else (loop (cdr items)))))))
#+END_SRC

Then =execute= gets complicated than before:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (execute)
  (let ((insts (get-contents pc)))
    (cond ((null? insts) 'done)
          ((car break-points) ;the right after instruction from the broken
           (set-car! break-points #f)
           (execute))
          ((and (not (eq? (car break-points) insts)) ;ensure this is not the point broken
                (memq insts (cdr break-points)))
           (set-car! break-points insts) ;save the broken point
           'broken)
          (else
           (let ((inst (car insts)))
             (if trace?
                 (let ((label-entry ((find-from-val labels-package)

                       (begin (newline)

                   (begin (newline)
                          (display (instruction-text inst)))))
             ((instruction-execution-proc inst))
             (set! number-execs (1+ number-execs))
             (execute))))))
#+END_SRC

And interfaces:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in dispatch
              ((eq? message 'proceed-machine)
               (if (car break-points)
                   (begin (set-contents! pc (car break-points))
                          (execute))
                   (error "There in no broken point to proceed from -- PROCEED-MACHINE")))
              ((eq? message 'set-breakpoint)

              ((eq? message 'cancel-all-breakpoints)
               (set! break-points '(#f)))
#+END_SRC

To procedural syntax:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (set-breakpoint machine label n)
  ((machine 'set-breakpoint) label n))

(define (cancel-breakpoint machine label n)
  ((machine 'cancel-breakpoint) label n))

(define (proceed-machine machine)
  (machine 'proceed-machine))

(define (cancel-all-breakpoints machine)
  (machine 'cancel-all-breakpoints))
#+END_SRC

Then let's test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-breakpoint gcd-machine 'test-b 4)

;The object test-b, passed as an argument to assoc, is not the correct type.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

It is due to that the =find-from-val= and =find-from-key= does not agree in
where the =labels= should position. Let us make them consist along with
=loopup-label=.

Then re-run the test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set-register-contents! gcd-machine 'a 202)

;Value: done

(set-register-contents! gcd-machine 'b 43)

;Value: done

#+END_SRC

Unfortunately our =proceed-machine= does not work as expected.

We should have defined as follows

                 (let ((inst (car insts)))
                   (if trace?
                       (let ((label-entry ((find-from-val labels-package)
                                           insts)))

#+END_SRC

To implement above register machine program, you need to use the wishful
thinking as we did in higher level procedure. For the commented code, it would
work if we use the commented code other than using intermediate register t, but
in anyway we will need =t= in later in the code, so it would be better not to
use the =flag= directly.

Then here is the transformation in step:

;; Then link together

#+END_SRC

Now we can construct machine we do this simulation; the result in =x= register.

Note that in this version, we haven't used any stack operation, that means this
is iterative process unlike the preceding implementation.
** Maintaining the Illusion of Infinite Memory
In this section, we are going to learn how our evaluator manage the memory under
the hood. This is quite simple and compact algorithm that we are going to see;
but it resolves a lot of difficulties otherwise we encountered with (or should
concern about).

To keep track of the contents of this section, you should draw diagram along with
emerging controller sequence as if you were a machine; otherwise you'll get feel
like you understood the core concept of this simple and compact algorithm but
only in spurious manner.
* The Explicit-Control Evaluator
Now we turn into the application of this new language. Actually this is not an
application but in more presentation about what's going on under the hood --
this is meant to explain what they assumed or omitted to describe in preceding
chapter, [[org:../MEGAsync/MIT Challenge/6.001/Chapter4.org][Metacircular Evaluator]].

Through this material, we will get the ability to implement meta circular
evaluator or even the other variants in hardware in principal. That is, if we
are patient enough to gathering all the stuffs to implement what we planned to
do, say the query language we developed in preceding chapter, we got the machine
in real world only for that purpose.

So for start, here they are going to /unwind/ the metacircular evaluator in
sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4.

From this point, we can get some intuition behind this concept through the
[[youtube:ikvAQ_lu31s?list=PL7BcsI5ueSNFPCEisbaoQ0kXIDX9rR5FF][lectures]] available in [[youtube:cIc8ZBMcqAc?list=PLE18841CABEA24090][online]]. So for recapitulation or to understand what concepts
the authors consider as core, before to go through this section, we'd better to
go through all the material before this section -- Register Machines.

Actually we can deduce a lot of useful informations using contraction as we did
in procedural definition (or module) in static sense -- analogous to the type
contraction rather than behavior specifications. The [[youtube:1eQpcms7c98&t=635s][lecture]] explains this
concept consistently through this term of lectures.

So using the static information (deduced by static analysis by human not the
machine; thus for human), we can put together all the relevant parts into one
chuck along with the contracts not only in the high level language also in this
very low level assembly language uniformly.
** The Core of the Explicit-Control Evaluator
** Sequence Evaluation and Tail Recursion
To deal with the tail recursion, we need to handle the last expression in the
evaluation of sequence differently.
** Conditionals, Assignments, and Definitions

Here we used the assumption or "cheat," which isn't actually cheat according to
the footnote in the text. This is due to the analysis phase in our interpreter
as noted in section 4.1.4; all the expression analyzed statically and the source
level transformation is one of the static process, it is done at that phase. We
can verify this fact -- our interpreter do the static analysis before execution
-- with the following example:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(lambda (x) (define y 5) (define y 2) x)

;duplicate internal definitions for (#[uninterned-symbol 38 y]) in |#[unnamed-procedure]|
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

If it were not doing the static analysis, it couldn't the duplicated internal
definitions since it is the body of lambda expression, which is not supposed to
be evaluated until it is applied.

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(start eceval)

;;; EC-Eval input:
(cond (false 5) (false 2) (true 3) (else 1))

(total-pushes = 9 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:

;;; EC-Eval input:
(let* ((x 5) (y (+ x 2))) (+ x y))

(total-pushes = 26 maximum-depth = 8)
;;; EC-Eval value:
12

#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 5.24
=Cond= special form is like combination of =ev-if= and =ev-application=. That is
it need to loop through the clauses and for each clause like =evl-application=
loop through in =ev-appl-operand-loop=, and within that loop, it need to branch
depending on the evaluation of =cond-predicate= of each clause as =ev-if= did,
if it were true, it need to setup to call =ev-sequence= as
=ev-appl-accum-last-arg= did.

Here is the register code do the works:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
ev-cond
;; Input exp env continue
;; Output val
;; Write all (call the ev-sequence)
;; Stack unchanged
    (assign unev (op cond-clauses) (reg exp))
    (save continue)
cond-clause-loop
;; Input unev env stack (top as return point)
;; Output val
;; Write all
;; Stack top value removed
    (assign exp (op cond-first-clause) (reg unev))
    (test (op cond-else-clause?) (reg exp))
    (branch (label cond-else-clause))
    (test (op cond-last-clause?) (reg unev))
    (branch (label cond-last-clause))
cond-pred
    (save unev)
    (save exp)
    (save env)
    (assign exp (op cond-predicate) (reg exp))
    (assign continue (label cond-pred-decide))
    (goto (label eval-dispatch))
cond-pred-decide
    (restore env)
    (restore exp)
    (restore unev)
    (test (op true?) (reg val))
    (branch (label cond-actions))
    (assign unev (op cond-rest-clauses) (reg unev))
    (goto (label cond-clause-loop))
cond-actions
;; Input exp, env
;; Output val
;; Write all
;; Stack top removed
    (assign unev (op cond-actions) (reg exp))
    (goto (label ev-sequence))

    (test (op cond-last-clause?) (reg unev))
    (test (op not) (reg flag))

    (goto (label eval-dispatch))

    (restore env)
    (restore exp)
    (test (op true?) (reg val))
    (branch (label cond-actions))
    (restore continue)
    (goto (reg continue))
#+END_SRC

Now it works as expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(start eceval)


;;; EC-Eval input:
(cond (false 5) (false 2) (true 3) (else 1))

(total-pushes = 10 maximum-depth = 4)
;;; EC-Eval value:
3

#+END_SRC

Now test the tail recursion problem:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; from recitation 26 of 2004
(define (list? x)
  (cond ((null? x) true)
        ((pair? x) (list? (cdr x)))))
(define z (list 1))
(set-cdr! z z)
(list? z)
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define z (list 1))

(total-pushes = 8 maximum-depth = 6)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(set-cdr! z z)

(total-pushes = 8 maximum-depth = 5)
;;; EC-Eval value:
#!unspecific

;;; EC-Eval input:
(list? z)
  C-c C-c;Quit!
#+END_SRC

Works as expected.
*** Exercise 5.25
As we learned from section 4.2, the only change is the application from the
applicative Scheme.

That is, rather than evaluating all the operands before application, we need to
hand over the operands without evaluating since the operands needed are
different in primitive procedure's from compound procedure's.

We also need to support additional data structure called thunk since it is
needed to distinguish the delayed object from the normal values.

Also we need to handle the =if= expression somewhat differently from the
applicative one since it need =actual-value= for value of its predicate part.

Note that we can not assume the =actual-value= (implicitly =force-it= too) is
available as machine operations as the text did; we need to unwind those
procedure explicitly into register subroutines since =actual-value= and
=force-it= wrapping around the =eval= process in it. So we need to unwrap those
until we got the procedures that does not inherit the any other process that is
implemented as subroutines in our register machine (but we are good to use the
=delay-it= procedure since it is just syntactic procedure or representation of
thunk ADT).

So to summarize, we can assume the following procedures as machine operators:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; Exercise 5.25 delayed one
(define (delay-it exp env)
  (list 'thunk exp env))

(define (thunk? obj)
  (tagged-list? obj 'thunk))

(define (thunk-exp thunk) (cadr thunk))
(define (thunk-env thunk) (caddr thunk))

;; "thunk" that has been forced and is storing its (memoized) value
(define (evaluated-thunk? obj)
  (tagged-list? obj 'evaluated-thunk))

(define (thunk-value evaluated-thunk) (cadr evaluated-thunk))
#+END_SRC

But we should implement the following ones as subroutines:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (actual-value exp env)
  (force-it (eval exp env)))

(define (force-it obj)
  (cond ((thunk? obj)
         (let ((result (actual-value
                        (thunk-exp obj)
                        (thunk-env obj))))
           (set-car! obj 'evaluated-thunk)
           (set-car! (cdr obj) result)  ; replace exp with its value
           (set-cdr! (cdr obj) '())     ; forget unneeded env
           result))
        ((evaluated-thunk? obj)
         (thunk-value obj))
        (else obj)))
#+END_SRC

Here is the code translated. Observe the similarity of the accumulation argument
loop between the primitive and compound one -- it is more easy to see in above
high level language description; if we want to do, we could have modulate the
duplicate code into one general subroutine which will accept more arguments as
input registers or on stack. We will come back this issue in later.

Now let's test:

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)

** Running the Evaluator
*** Exercise 5.26
**** a.
Since the defined procedure captured iterative process, we expect, if our
register machine handles the tail recursion correctly, the maximum stack depth
would not change:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 204 maximum-depth = 10)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 3)

(total-pushes = 134 maximum-depth = 10)
;;; EC-Eval value:
6

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 30)

(total-pushes = 1079 maximum-depth = 10)
;;; EC-Eval value:
265252859812191058636308480000000

#+END_SRC

And it turns out 10.
**** b.
From those data, and as it is linear, we can deduce the formular as $P(n) = 35n+29$.
*** Exercise 5.27
Here is the data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 3)

(total-pushes = 80 maximum-depth = 18)
;;; EC-Eval value:
6

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 10)

(total-pushes = 304 maximum-depth = 53)
;;; EC-Eval value:
3628800

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 30)

(total-pushes = 944 maximum-depth = 153)
;;; EC-Eval value:
265252859812191058636308480000000

#+END_SRC

From this fact, we can deduce the =maximum-depth= as $5n + 3$, and
=total-pushes= as $32n - 16$.

So the table gets as

|           | Maximum depth | Number of pushes |
|-----------+---------------+------------------|
| Recursive | 5n + 3        | 32n - 16         |
| factorial |               |                  |
|-----------+---------------+------------------|
| Iterative | 10            | 35n + 29         |
| factorial |               |                  |
*** Exercise 5.28
Let's modify our register machine not to be tail recursive. Then let's re-run
[[Exercise 5.26][exercise 5.26]]'s factorial -- iterative one:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 218 maximum-depth = 29)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 3)

(total-pushes = 144 maximum-depth = 23)
;;; EC-Eval value:
6

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 30)

(total-pushes = 1143 maximum-depth = 104)
;;; EC-Eval value:
265252859812191058636308480000000
#+END_SRC

Now the =maximum-depth= gets $3n+14$ not the constant 10 and =total-pushes= gets
$37n + 33$, which is definitely large number than previous one.

How about the recurvise definition?
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 3)

(total-pushes = 86 maximum-depth = 27)
;;; EC-Eval value:
6

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 10)

(total-pushes = 324 maximum-depth = 83)
;;; EC-Eval value:
3628800

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 30)

(total-pushes = 1004 maximum-depth = 243)
;;; EC-Eval value:
265252859812191058636308480000000
#+END_SRC

As expected this one also has involved more stack operations than previous since
this version of evaluator execute instructions that is useless.
*** Exercise 5.29
**** a.
From the experiments, we extracted the following data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 5)

(total-pushes = 408 maximum-depth = 28)
;;; EC-Eval value:
5

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 10)

(total-pushes = 4944 maximum-depth = 53)
;;; EC-Eval value:
55

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 15)

(total-pushes = 55232 maximum-depth = 78)
;;; EC-Eval value:
610

#+END_SRC

So we can deduce that =maximum-depth= is given as $5n + 3$.
**** b.
From the experiments conducted in *a.*, we can inspect that the =total-pushes=
increase proportionally to the value of =(fib n)=. As we reasoned in the
exercise of 1.2.2 section, we know the =(fib n)= is exponential; so as to
=total-pushes=.

As we did in that exercise to deduce the exact number of =(fib n)=, here we
analyze the =total-pushes= using the induction on the definition of =fib=. We
can do this analysis since from the controller sequence of =eceval= should
evaluate the subproblems in exact same manner with the entry calling of =(fib
n)=.

From this argument, we can formulate =total-pushes= as
\[S(n) = S(n - 1) + S(n - 2) + k\]
, where /S/ denotes the =total-pushes= of input number =n=.

Now let's deduce the =k= from the experiments:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 3)

(total-pushes = 128 maximum-depth = 18)
;;; EC-Eval value:
2

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 4)

(total-pushes = 240 maximum-depth = 23)
;;; EC-Eval value:
3

#+END_SRC

From =(fib 3)=, =(fib 4)=, =(fib 5)=, we can get $k = 40$. Let's verify this on
different data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 14)

(total-pushes = 34120 maximum-depth = 73)
;;; EC-Eval value:
377

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 16)

(total-pushes = 89392 maximum-depth = 83)
;;; EC-Eval value:
987

#+END_SRC

From these set of data, we also get $k = 40$, as expected.

Now let's try to answer final question of this exercise. So far we deduced that
/S/ also can be formulated "Fibonacci" number like equation -- the doubly
recursive equation.

So now we turn to what is the initial conditions of that equation, that is, like
the ones from =fib= -- the base cases =(fib 0)= equals 0, =(fib 1)= equals 1.

After that, we can relate these numbers with the numbers of Fibonacci as we
required.

Here is the base cases:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 0)

(total-pushes = 16 maximum-depth = 8)
;;; EC-Eval value:
0

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 1)

(total-pushes = 16 maximum-depth = 8)
;;; EC-Eval value:
1

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 2)

(total-pushes = 72 maximum-depth = 13)
;;; EC-Eval value:
1

#+END_SRC

So /S(0) = 16/ and /S(1) = 16/; and for verification, /S(2) = S(1) + S(0) + 40 =
72/ as expected. From these data, it seems like we can equate as /S(n) = a
Fib(n + 1) + b/. Let's verify by plugging the right hand side formula into the
left hand side in the /S(n)/ formula:
/a Fib(n + 1) + b = a Fib (n) + a Fib (n - 1) + 2 b + 40/, which reduced to
/b = - 40/ and if we plug this result into the base case, we got /S(1) = a Fib
(2) - 40/, which, in turn, means /a = 56/.

So the solution is /S(n) = 56 Fib(n + 1) - 40/.
*** Exercise 5.30
**** a.
We need to use =flag= register to signal that these erroneous process occurred.
Before modifying the =loopkup= operation as outlined in the text, we need to
inspect what the value of =flag= can be in user defined process. And then we
should design the special value that signal error, which are set in =flag=
register.

For the current version of register machine, we set =flag= as the result of
execution of condition operation; we need to fix this since we are going to
define special value that can not be set in user defined process but the current
one there is no restriction on the value of =flag= user can cause.

Moreover, as we are using the =flag= register only in the =branch= to determine
where to proceed, we don't need =flag= to be other than boolean. So it is
reasonable to restrict the condition operation in =test= can only set the
value of =flag= to true or false.

We can make contract informally to the user of our register machine but the
implementor of =eceval= machine is one of the user of this. And this is the
restriction =eceval= implementor to impose to the user of his machine. So maybe
it is none of the business for the implementor of our register machine but for
the =eceval= evaluator; that means, if the =eceval= implementor is along with
the contract that the value of =flag= should be boolean in processing user
defined process -- the unwinding process, it is good to go.

So now, we restricted the =flag= value to be boolean in normal process, we are
good to define whatever value we want to use the signaling error.

So for presentation let's change the =lookup-variable-value= to support the idea
outlined above:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (lookup-variable-value var env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
             (env-loop (enclosing-environment env)))
            ((eq? var (car vars))
             (car vals))
            (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
        (error "Unbound variable" var)
        (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
          (scan (frame-variables frame)
                (frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
#+END_SRC

And then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    ev-variable
    ;; (assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (reg exp) (reg env))
    (assign val (op lookup-variable-value-with-error) (reg exp) (reg env) (reg flag))
    (test (op error-flag?) (reg flag))
    ;; unbound-variable
    ;; Input: exp -- given unbound variable
    (branch (label unbound-variable))
    (goto (reg continue))

    unbound-variable
    (assign val (op list) (const "Unbound variable") (reg exp))
    (goto (label signal-error))
#+END_SRC

With this configuration, let's test it:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
x

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
#t

;;; EC-Eval input:
y

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
#t

#+END_SRC

Unfortunately this idea won't work since we can't change the actual contents of
=flag= register unless =assign= it directly; there is a way to embody this idea,
that is, to unwind this machine operation into subroutine. Then we are able to
mutate the flag register as we wanted; but it thought as would be better to goto
=signal-error= entry point rather than to mutate the flag register and then go
back to caller. However there is some issues around this problem like the make
the stack or other registers to be consist with the contract -- this is the
responsibilities to the caller not the =lookup-variable= itself.

Whatever it be, for now, we are not going to implement the
=lookup-variable-value= procedure as subroutine.

So it would be better to get back to the original idea suggested in the text --
use the value that can not be set by user, that is using the type-tag I think.

Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (error-exp? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'error))

(define (make-error-exp exp) `(error ,exp))

(define (lookup-variable-value-with-error var env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
             (env-loop (enclosing-environment env)))
            ((eq? var (car vars))
             (car vals))
            (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
        (make-error-exp `("Unbound variable" ,var))
        (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
          (scan (frame-variables frame)
                (frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    ev-variable
    ;; (assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (reg exp) (reg env))
    (assign val (op lookup-variable-value-with-error) (reg exp) (reg env))
    (test (op error-exp?) (reg val))
    ;; unbound-variable
    ;; Input: val -- Error message
    (branch (label signal-error))
    (goto (reg continue))
#+END_SRC

Let's test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
y
(error (Unbound variable y))

;;; EC-Eval input:
x

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
5

#+END_SRC

Now it runs as expected. Here we chose to delegate the duty producing error
message to the procedure who signal this error rather than to the caller -- just
hand over this to the =signal-error= subroutine.

Now let's convert all the =error= expression into the one outlined above:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (extend-environment vars vals base-env)
  (if (= (length vars) (length vals))
      (cons (make-frame vars vals) base-env)
      (if (< (length vars) (length vals))
          ;; (error "Too many arguments supplied" vars vals)
          (make-error-exp `("Too many arguments supplied" ,vars ,vals))
          ;; (error "Too few arguments supplied" vars vals)
          (make-error-exp `("Too few arguments supplied" ,vars ,vals))
          )))

(define (set-variable-value! var val env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
             (env-loop (enclosing-environment env)))
            ((eq? var (car vars))
             (set-car! vals val))
            (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
        ;; (error "Unbound variable -- SET!" var)
        (make-error-exp `("Unbound variable -- SET!" ,var))
        (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
          (scan (frame-variables frame)
                (frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
#+END_SRC

Then in =ev-assignment=,
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    ;; (perform
    ;;  (op set-variable-value!) (reg unev) (reg val) (reg env))
    (assign val (op set-variable-value!) (reg unev) (reg val) (reg env))
    (test (op error-exp?) (reg val))
    (branch (label signal-error))
    (assign val (const ok))
    (goto (reg continue))
#+END_SRC

And in =compound-apply=,
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (assign env (op extend-environment)
            (reg unev) (reg argl) (reg env))
    (test (op error-exp?) (reg env))
    (branch (label unmatched-argument-number-error))
    (assign unev (op procedure-body) (reg proc))
    (goto (label ev-sequence))


    unmatched-argument-number-error
    (restore continue)
    (assign val (reg env))
    (goto (label signal-error))
#+END_SRC

These are all the procedure signal error in [[file:Exercise/ch5-eceval-support.scm][support file]].

Let's test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(set! y 3)
(error (Unbound variable -- SET! y))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(define (test x y) 5)

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(test 2 3 1 3)
(error (Too many arguments supplied (x y) (2 3 1 3)))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(test 1)
(error (Too few arguments supplied (x y) (1)))

#+END_SRC

Great! But there is also problem in this approach, that is, user can produce
this tagged data as they want. Like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define x '(error "This should be forbidden by user"))

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
x
(error This should be forbidden by user)

#+END_SRC

Or
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define y '(primitive "this also should be forbiddend"))

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(y 5)
;The object "this also should be forbiddend" is not applicable.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 2) => Specify a procedure to use in its place.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

We need to cope with this situation by noting that user only can construct pair
data -- thus list data -- via the =cons=. So if we make change the pair
structure to the tagged data like =(pair x y)= then we are free from this kind
of error:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in primitive-procedures
  (list (list 'car cadr)
        (list 'cdr caddr)
        (list 'cons (lambda (x y) `(pair ,x ,y)))
        (list 'null? (lambda (p) (and (tagged-list? p 'pair) (null? (cdr p)))))
        (list 'pair? (lambda (p) (tagged-list? p 'pair)))
        ...)

,*** in setup-environment
    (define-variable! 'nil '(pair) initial-env)
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define x (cons 'error (cons "This should be forbidden by user" nil)))

(total-pushes = 19 maximum-depth = 11)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
x

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
(pair error (pair This should be forbidden by user (pair)))

#+END_SRC

Here we used =cons= rather than =quote=; but it should work if we used =quote=
instead -- we need to change the =test-of-quotation= procedure as subroutine
that converts underlying pair structure into that of =eceval=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (text-of-quotation exp)
  (tree-map identity-procedure
            (lambda (x y) `(pair ,x ,y))
            '(pair)
            (cadr exp)))
#+END_SRC

=tree-map= is the one implemented in [[Exercise 5.12][exercise 5.12]].

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define x '(error "This should be forbidden by user"))

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
x

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
(pair error (pair This should be forbidden by user (pair)))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(define y '(primitive "this also should be forbiddend"))

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(y 5)
unknown-procedure-type-error

#+END_SRC

Now we don't need any additional definition of =nil=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
'()

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
(pair)

;;; EC-Eval input:
(null? '())

(total-pushes = 5 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
#t

#+END_SRC

For completeness, we should define print procedure for our pair structure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (user-print object)
  (cond ((compound-procedure? object)
         (display (list 'compound-procedure
                        (procedure-parameters object)
                        (procedure-body object)
                        '<procedure-env>)))
        ((pair?* object)
         (print-pair* object))
        (else (display object))))

;; Structural induction on pair
(define (print-pair* p)
  (define (iter p)
    (cond ((null?* p))
          ((pair?* p)
           (display " ")
           (display (car* p))
           (iter (cdr* p)))
          (else
           ;; not pair -- atomic expression
           (display " . ")
           (display p))))
  (display "(")
  (display (car* p))
  (iter (cdr* p))
  (display ")"))
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define x '(error "This should be forbidden by user"))

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
x

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
(error This should be forbidden by user)

;;; EC-Eval input:
(car x)

(total-pushes = 5 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
error

#+END_SRC

Works as expected. For efficiency, professional product would use bit-wise typed
data rather than this version -- typed using pair structure, as noted in text book.

Now we are good to apply our strategy to the rest of instructions that may
corrupt in some condition other than the ones in the support file, which
signaling with the =error= procedure. To do that, we first look into the
=eceval= code to figure out.

Here is the list:
- =self-eval=: It is good as it is
- =variable=: We handled this in =lookup-variable-value= procedure.
- =quote=:
  We need to handle
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(quote)

;Ill-formed syntax: (quote)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(quote x . y)

;Ill-formed syntax: (quote x . y)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC
- =lambda=:
  We need to handle
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(lambda)

;Ill-formed syntax: (lambda)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(lambda x)

;Ill-formed syntax: (lambda x)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(lambda x y . z)

;Ill-formed syntax: (lambda x y . z)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC
- =application=: =extend-environment= handles the error case. For the error
  during the application of primitive procedure, we will handle this *b.* part
  of this exercise.

  And should handle
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(x 1 . 4)

;Combination must be a proper list: (x 1 . 4)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC
- =begin= or =ev-sequence=:
  Should it accept empty sequence?
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(begin)

;Unspecified return value
  #+END_SRC

  For consistency with the =lambda= expression, let us choose above expression
  as ill-formed one.

  So we can say explicitly that the contraction of =ev-sequence='s input should
  not be empty.
- =if=:
  Should handle
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(if)

;Ill-formed syntax: (if)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(if x)

;Ill-formed syntax: (if x)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(if 1 2 3 4)

;Ill-formed syntax: (if 1 2 3 4)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(if 1 . 2)

;Ill-formed syntax: (if 1 . 2)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC
- =assignment=:
  Should handle
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set! x y z)

;Variable required in this context: x
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(set! x . y)

;Variable required in this context: x
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC

  But should we?
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define x 2)

;Value: x

(set! x)

;Value: 2

x

;Unassigned variable: x
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 3) => Specify a value to use instead of x.
; (RESTART 2) => Set x to a given value.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC
  This is just like =unset!= if it exists; but it is "Unassigned" not "Unbound"
  as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
y

;Unbound variable: y
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 3) => Specify a value to use instead of y.
; (RESTART 2) => Define y to a given value.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC

  The difference is that we can re-set the value:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(set! x 3)

;Unspecified return value
  #+END_SRC

  Maybe it is used internally, when we want to handle expression such as
  =letrec=. So it is not needed for now; let us choose to define such expression
  as ill-formed one.
- =definition=:
  Should handle
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define)

;Ill-formed syntax: (define)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(define x y z)

;Ill-formed syntax: (define x y z)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(define x . y)

;Ill-formed syntax: (define x . y)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
  #+END_SRC


As I've implemented those, let's test them:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(quote x . y)
(error (Ill-formed syntax (quote x . y)))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(quote)
(error (Ill-formed syntax (quote)))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(lambda)
(error (Ill-formed syntax (lambda)))

;;; EC-Eval input:

(error (Ill-formed syntax (lambda x)))

;;; EC-Eval input:

(error (Ill-formed syntax (lambda x y . z)))

;;; EC-Eval input:

;;; EC-Eval input:

(error (Ill-formed syntax (if x)))

;;; EC-Eval input:

;;; EC-Eval input:

(error (Ill-formed syntax (if 1 . 2)))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(set!)
(error (Ill-formed syntax (set!)))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(set! x)
(error (Ill-formed syntax (set! x)))

;;; EC-Eval input:

(error (Ill-formed syntax (set! x y z)))

;;; EC-Eval input:

(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:

;;; EC-Eval value:

;;; EC-Eval input:

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:

#+END_SRC

Of course the proper syntax expression works normally as expected.

Note that as we depends on the =read= procedure for the parsing expression,
unfortunately we cannot cope with the such errors handled by =read=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(1 . 2 . 3)
;Ill-formed dotted list: (1 |.| 2 |.| 3)
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC
**** b.
Actually this is analogous task we have done prior to the task of *a.* to
prevent from user producing our =error= ADT.

The goal would be followings
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(car 1)

;The object 1, passed as the first argument to car, is not the correct type.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 2) => Specify an argument to use in its place.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(cdr 1)

;The object 1, passed as the first argument to cdr, is not the correct type.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 2) => Specify an argument to use in its place.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.

(car 1 2 3)

;The procedure #[compiled-procedure 18 ("list" #x1) #x1a #x104588fc2] has been called with 3 arguments; it requires exactly 1 argument.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

Or more specifically we can learn from the "professional" product:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp cadr)
(named-lambda (cadr x)
  ((named-lambda (safe-car x)
     (if (pair? x)
         (car x)
         (error:not-a pair? x 'safe-car)))
   ((named-lambda (safe-cdr x)
      (if (pair? x)
          (cdr x)
          (error:not-a pair? x 'safe-cdr)))
    x)))
#+END_SRC

Or for the division case,
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(/ 5 0)

;Division by zero signalled by /.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

We got
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp /)
(case number-of-arguments
  ((1)

So to summarize,
- All of the arguments of above operations should be =number?=.
- In addition to that, for the comparing operations -- =<= and =>= -- should be =real?=.
- Especially for the division, except for the first dividend, 0 should not be
  passed; if the number of argument were 1, that number shouldn't be 0.
- Except division and subtraction, it is okay with any arity; for those, it
  should be at least 1 argument.


Here is the code:

Now let's test it:

;;; EC-Eval input:

#+END_SRC

If we want to hide the =pair= representation we are good to use the following
helper procedures:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (tree-map* leaf-op combine-op initial tree)
  (cond ((null?* tree) initial)
        ((not (pair?* tree)) (leaf-op tree))
        (else                           ;pair
         (combine-op
          (tree-map* leaf-op combine-op initial
                    (car* tree))
          (tree-map* leaf-op combine-op initial
                    (cdr* tree))))))

(define (pair*->pair p)
  (tree-map* identity-procedure cons '() p))

(define (represent-object* o)
  (if (pair?* o)
      (pair*->pair o)
      o))
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define >*
  (named-lambda (> . as)
    (if (all-arguments-to-be? real? as)
        (apply > as)
        (make-error-exp
         `("The object" ,(represent-object* as)
           ", passed as an argument to >, is not a real number.")))))
#+END_SRC

Now test this new behavior:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(> (cons 2 3))
(error (The object ((pair 2 3)) , passed as an argument to >, is not a real number.))

#+END_SRC

Turns out we need to map over the argument list:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define -*
  (ensure-arity-number-gt
   1
   (named-lambda (- . as)
     (if (all-arguments-to-be? number? as)
         (apply - as)
         (make-error-exp
          `("The object" ,(map represent-object* as)
            ", passed as an argument to -, is not a number."))))))
#+END_SRC

Then re-run!
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(> (cons 2 3))
(error (The object ((2 . 3)) , passed as an argument to >, is not a real number.))

;;; EC-Eval input:
(* (cons 2 3) (cons 1 (cons 3 2)))
(error (The object ((2 . 3) (1 3 . 2)) , passed as an argument to *, is not a number.))

#+END_SRC

Now works as expected.
* Compilation
Compilation is another strategy that takes opposite to what explicit control
evaluator takes: It lowers the higher level language into the very lower level
language, /natural language/ or /assembly language/. And this translated program
would be interpreted by the machine language interpreter -- CPU -- after
assembled.

This different strategy causes the great deal of changes of properties from the
evaluator. In evaluator, as it loads all the library -- the collection of
subroutines that implements the primitive operations of source language -- since
it does not what subroutines are going to be needed in interpreting, we can
develop the program dynamically. On the other hand, in the compile method, only the
required subroutines are going to be loaded in execution, since it knows what
the source code used in priori.

This is analogous situation from section 4.1.7; the compiler analyze or optimize
the instructions using the informations of the source code that can be deducted
in static manner. We should come to understand why modern computer programming
language especially the one for system program, use the strongly typed language:
The compiler can deduce more information from the code than weakly typed one
since it knows what going to be returned and what would be passed, and so on in
compile time in addition to the type inference for assisting the programmer.

As Scheme is the dynamically typed language, the compiler can not do the clever
things done by the compiler of strongly typed language like Java or Scala or
Clojure; although this fact, the compiler can works a lot than the evaluator.

The main idea that is implemented in this section is annotate between the
instruction sequences; and using that information, compiler can save additional
stack operations around instruction sequences. It is embodied by structural
definition over the compiler clause structure: Defining manually for all the
primitive clauses and inductive combination rule.

In addition to this quite "clever" idea, we can eliminates all the evaluator
specific instructions -- e.g. the instructions involving the =exp= and =unev=
registers and the =continue= to go to next entry point, and so on. Since our
compiler is not the program in the machine language but in the Scheme -- higher
level language, it can manipulate the given expression directly using the
pointer to the data structure allocated heap (or list structured memory).

** Structure of the Compiler
*** Exercise 5.31
You should look through the lecture, 10A of SICP, since the relevant and useful
diagram appears in the lecture. I've drawn that diagram based on the given
examples with my digital paper.

For the conclusion, the first one and second one can be eliminated all the stack
operations otherwise involved, and third one results in pair of =env= save and
store, that of =proc=, and that of =argl= register. For the last one, pair of
=proc= and =argl= survived.

Using the information that the operator expression is symbol, we could reduce
the 2 pair of stack operation from previous version.
**** b.
Alyssa P. Hacker ignores the time it takes to analyze the instructions to
optimize the code. As we already have seen in section 4.1.7, the analysis times
can not be ignored especially if it trying to extract great deal of information
from the code, and then exploit that fact to optimize.

So if we do analyze in the execution time, it will have overhead when the code
executed for the first time; well, it can achieve efficient execution after that
evaluation but the overhead would not the one user ever expected.

On the other hand, the compiler can analyze the code in compile time, which is
not the execution time, so the user get the behavior of the program consistently
with their expectation -- it takes same time for execution. So compiler can
introduce more sophisticated algorithm to improve the efficiency of resulting
code since it is done once and compile time.
** Compiling Expressions
** Compiling Combinations
** Combining Instruction Sequences
** An Example of Compiled Code
*** Exercise 5.33
Before compiling this altered one, we can expect what difference it would make
from the informal (or the code) from this section. We expect this altered one
and original one different in view point of efficiency. Here is why:

Since this altered version place the recursive call to the last argument of last
combination expression, it needs to preserve the =env= register around the
compilation of last argument (since in our compiler, last argument would be
compiled first and the first to be last); since it alter =env= and the first
code compiled needs =env=, =env= should be wrapped by =save= and =restore=
around the compilation of last argument -- recursive call.

However the original version compile the recursive call lastly (or put
in other way, appended at the very end), and the last argument does not modify
the =env= register -- =lookup-variable-value= -- it saves pair of =save= &
=restore= stack operation compared with altered version.

Consequently the original one would be more efficient. Then let's verify this
fact:

Unfortunately our expectation is invalid: The number of instructions are same in
both; the original one should =argl= register rather than =env= register. So the
overall efficiency would equal opposed our first expectation since the
accumulated stack contents equal in both.

*** Exercise 5.36
Our compiler produces right-to-left order of evaluation for operands of
combination in contrast to the explicit control evaluator in preceding [[The Explicit-Control Evaluator][section]].
It is determined by the =construct-arglist= in the =compile-application=.

To change this order according to previous left-to-right order, all we need to
change is the =construct-arglist= and =code-to-get-last-arg= not to use
=reverse= and to use =append= instead of =cons= respectively:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (construct-arglist operand-codes) ;no reverse!
  (if (null? operand-codes)
      (make-instruction-sequence '() '(argl)
                                 '((assign argl (const ()))))
      (let ((code-to-get-last-arg
             (append-instruction-sequences
              (car operand-codes)
              (make-instruction-sequence '(val) '(argl)
                                         '((assign argl (op list) (reg val)))))))
        (if (null? (cdr operand-codes))
            code-to-get-last-arg
            (preserving '(env)
                        code-to-get-last-arg
                        (code-to-get-rest-args
                         (cdr operand-codes)))))))

(define (code-to-get-rest-args operand-codes)
  (let ((code-for-next-arg
         (preserving '(argl)
          (car operand-codes)
          (make-instruction-sequence
           '(val argl) '(val argl)            ;updated
           '((assign val (op list) (reg val)) ;changed
             (assign argl
                     (op append) (reg argl) (reg val))))))) ;changed
    (if (null? (cdr operand-codes))
        code-for-next-arg
        (preserving '(env)
         code-for-next-arg
         (code-to-get-rest-args (cdr operand-codes))))))
#+END_SRC

Now the instruction appending each argument code to the argument list being
constructed code got doubled -- from =cons= to make singleton =list= from newly
constructed argument and then =append= that to argument list in constructing.

Moreover, now the complexity of the constructing the whole argument list got
quadratic order of growth rather than linear order as previous.
*** Exercise 5.37
This is the place where the exercise [[Exercise 5.31][5.31]] can play its role or be verified
concretely. First, let's modify the =preserving= procedure so that it always
=save= and =restore= given registers around the first instruction sequence:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (preserving regs seq1 seq2)
  (if (null? regs)
      (append-instruction-sequences seq1 seq2)
      (let ((first-reg (car regs)))
        (preserving (cdr regs)
             (make-instruction-sequence
              (list-union (list first-reg)
                          (registers-needed seq1))
              (list-difference (registers-modified seq1)
                               (list first-reg))
              (append `((save ,first-reg))
                      (statements seq1)
                      `((restore ,first-reg))))
             seq2))))

57 versus 29.
**** Conclusion
By using the "annotate" feature of =preserving=, we can halve the instructions.
*** Exercise 5.38
**** a.
Based on the problem statement, =spread-arguments= has form of
=(spread-arguments <operands>)=; and it should have following skeleton code:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
<complie first argument; targeted to arg1; linkage to next>
<complie last (second) argument; targeted to arg2; linkage to next;
 preserving arg1 register>
#+END_SRC

For the last linkage point is arbitrary; but if we think about the use cases
followed by this sub-exercise, it implies we should link these code with =next=.

In addition to these, we need to preserve the =env= register around the compiled
code of first argument since the second argument need to be evaluated in that =env=.

Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (spread-arguments args)
  (let ((a1 (car args))
        (a2 (cadr args)))
    (preserving
     '(env)
     (compile a1 'arg1 'next)
     (preserving
      '(arg1)
      (compile a2 'arg2 'next)
      (make-instruction-sequence
       '(arg1) '() '())))))
#+END_SRC

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (spread-arguments '(x y)))
((env) (arg1 arg2)
 ((assign arg1 (op lookup-variable-value) (const x) (reg env))
  (assign arg2 (op lookup-variable-value) (const y) (reg env))))
#+END_SRC

For the test of recursive case -- compiling each argument can alter the
preceding target register, we delegate after *b.* since for now we don't have
any compile clause that alter the argument registers.
**** b.
Then we can easily implements the open-code clauses. First let's implement the
equal procedure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-= exp target linkage)
  (end-with-linkage
   linkage
   (append-instruction-sequences
    (spread-arguments (operands exp))
    (make-instruction-sequence
     '(arg1 arg2)
     (list target)
     `((assign ,target (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2)))))))
#+END_SRC

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (compile-= '(= 5 2) 'val 'next))
(() (arg1 arg2 val)
 ((assign arg1 (const 5))
  (assign arg2 (const 2))
  (assign val (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))))
#+END_SRC

Let's install it into the =compile=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (=? exp) (tagged-list? exp '=))
#+END_SRC

And then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in compile
        ((=? exp) (compile-= exp target linkage))
        ((application? exp)
         (compile-application exp target linkage))
#+END_SRC

Then we can test the recursive case, which we couldn't in *a.*
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (compile '(= (= 5 2) (= 2 1))
         'val 'next))

(()
 (arg1 arg2 val)
 ((assign arg1 (const 5))
  (assign arg2 (const 2))
  (assign arg1 (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (save arg1)
  (assign arg1 (const 2))
  (assign arg2 (const 1))
  (assign arg2 (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (restore arg1)
  (assign val (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))))
#+END_SRC

As it verified, now let's add the rest open-code primitives.

Before implementing each of the primitives, observe the commonalities among the
open-code things; the only difference is the operation name: Let's exploit them!
If we restrict the open code primitives only allowed to be binary, then we can
exploit that a lot:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-open-coded-prim exp target linkage op)
  (end-with-linkage
   linkage
   (append-instruction-sequences
    (spread-arguments (operands exp))
    (make-instruction-sequence
     '(arg1 arg2)
     (list target)
     `((assign ,target (op ,op) (reg arg1) (reg arg2)))))))

;; open-code primitive dictionary
(define open-coded-prims '((= =) (* *) (- -) (+ +)))

(define (open-coded-prims? exp)
  (assoc (operator exp) open-coded-prims))
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,**+ in compile procedure
...
        ;; ((=? exp) (compile-= exp target linkage))
        ((open-coded-prims? exp) =>
         (lambda (op-binding)
           (compile-open-coded-prim exp target linkage (cadr op-binding))))
        (application? exp)
...
#+END_SRC

But since in *d.* part we want to extend particular operations to take arbitrary
number of argument, they needs special treatment other than this; we'll comeback
this issue at *d.* part.

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; The previous one works well in this new scheme
(pp (compile '(= (= 5 2) (= 2 1))
         'val 'next))
(()
 (arg1 arg2 val)
 ((assign arg1 (const 5))
  (assign arg2 (const 2))
  (assign arg1 (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (save arg1)
  (assign arg1 (const 2))
  (assign arg2 (const 1))
  (assign arg2 (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (restore arg1)
  (assign val (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))))

;; Complex one also works well
(pp (compile '(= (+ (- 5 2) (* 1 2)) 5)
             'val 'next))
(()
 (arg1 arg2 val)
 ((assign arg1 (const 5))
  (assign arg2 (const 2))
  (assign arg1 (op -) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (save arg1)
  (assign arg1 (const 1))
  (assign arg2 (const 2))
  (assign arg2 (op *) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (restore arg1)
  (assign arg1 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (assign arg2 (const 5))
  (assign val (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))))
#+END_SRC

In addition to this feature, we may want to ensure the given expression has only
two operands. We can ensure this with following modification:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (open-coded-prims? exp)
  (and (= (length (operands exp)) 2)    ;binary
       (assoc (operator exp) open-coded-prims)))
#+END_SRC
**** c.
Then now let's try to compile =factorial= in this new strategy:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (compile
 '(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
 'val
 'next))

((env)
 (val)
 ((assign val (op make-compiled-procedure) (label entry55) (reg env))
  (goto (label after-lambda54))
  entry55
  (assign env (op compiled-procedure-env) (reg proc))
  (assign env (op extend-environment) (const (n)) (reg argl) (reg env))
  (assign arg1 (op lookup-variable-value) (const n) (reg env))
  (assign arg2 (const 1))
  (assign val (op =) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (test (op false?) (reg val))
  (branch (label false-branch57))
  true-branch58
  (assign val (const 1))
  (goto (reg continue))
  false-branch57
  (save continue)
  (save env)
  (assign proc (op lookup-variable-value) (const factorial) (reg env))
  (assign arg1 (op lookup-variable-value) (const n) (reg env))
  (assign arg2 (const 1))
  (assign val (op -) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (assign argl (op list) (reg val))
  (test (op primitive-procedure?) (reg proc))
  (branch (label primitive-branch61))
  compiled-branch60
  (assign continue (label proc-return62))
  (assign val (op compiled-procedure-entry) (reg proc))
  (goto (reg val))
  proc-return62
  (assign arg1 (reg val))
  (goto (label after-call59))
  primitive-branch61
  (assign arg1 (op apply-primitive-procedure) (reg proc) (reg argl))
  after-call59
  (restore env)
  (assign arg2 (op lookup-variable-value) (const n) (reg env))
  (assign val (op *) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (restore continue)
  (goto (reg continue))
  after-if56
  after-lambda54
  (perform (op define-variable!) (const factorial) (reg val) (reg env))
  (assign val (const ok))))
#+END_SRC

Got way more cleaner than [[Exercise 5.33][previous]].
**** d.
Since =*= and =+= satisfy the associative rule, we may exploit this property to
the compiler; but for the consistency with possible further extension where
primitive procedure does not satisfy the associative rule -- =-= , =/= , and so
on -- here we are going to implement the arithmetic operation with arbitrary
arity in =fold-right= manner -- calculate the rightmost operands first.

To deduce the algorithm, we should play with simple examples: Let's think about
=(+ 1 2 3 4)=. We would like to produce the code by compiling as follows
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(assign arg2 (const 4))
(assign arg1 (const 3))
(assign arg2 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
(assign arg1 (const 2))
(assign arg2 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
(assign arg1 (const 1))
(assign target (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
#+END_SRC

From this example, we can observe the first and last instruction treated specially.

As consequence, in general, compiling =(+ a1 a2 a3 a4)= should produce
#+BEGIN_SRC text
<compile a4; target to arg2; linkage to next; preserving env>
<compile a3; target to arg1; linkage to next; preserving env, arg2>
(assign arg2 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
<compile a2; target to arg1; linkage to next; preserving env, arg2>
(assign arg2 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
<compile a1; target to arg1; linkage to next; preserving arg2>
(assign target (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
<code for goto linkage point>
#+END_SRC

This is very much the same as the =construct-arglist=. Here is the code for =+=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-+ exp target linkage)

  (define (code-to-rest-+ operands)
    (let* ((last-operand? (no-operands? (rest-operands operands)))
           (next-target
            (if last-operand?
                target
                'arg2))
           (code-for-next-+
            (preserving
             '(arg2)
             (compile (first-operand operands)
                      'arg1 'next)
             (make-instruction-sequence
              '(arg1 arg2) (list next-target)
              `((assign ,next-target (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2)))))))
      (if last-operand?
          code-for-next-+
          (preserving
           '(env)
           code-for-next-+
           (code-to-rest-+ (rest-operands operands))))))

  (let ((operands (operands exp)))
    (let ((number-of-arguments (length operands)))
      (case number-of-arguments
        ((0)
         (end-with-linkage
          linkage
          (make-instruction-sequence
           '() (list target))
          `((assign ,target (const 0)))))
        ((1)
         (compile (first-operand operands)
                  target linkage))
        (else
         (let ((operands (reverse operands)))
           (end-with-linkage
            linkage
            (preserving
             '(env)
             (compile (first-operand operands)
                      'arg2 'next)
             (code-to-rest-+ (rest-operands operands))))))))))
#+END_SRC

Then let's install this:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; detector for +
(define (+? exp) (tagged-list? exp '+))
#+END_SRC

And
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in compile clause
        ;; ((=? exp) (compile-= exp target linkage))
        ((+? exp) (compile-+ exp target linkage))
        ((open-coded-prims? exp) =>
         (lambda (op-binding)
           (compile-open-coded-prim exp target linkage (cadr op-binding))))
        (application? exp)
#+END_SRC

Then test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; test for compile-+
(pp (compile '(+ 1 2 3 4) 'val 'next))
(()
 (arg2 arg1 val)
 ((assign arg2 (const 4))
  (assign arg1 (const 3))
  (assign arg2 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (assign arg1 (const 2))
  (assign arg2 (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))
  (assign arg1 (const 1))
  (assign val (op +) (reg arg1) (reg arg2))))
#+END_SRC

Note that =code-to-rest-+= can be generalized to any of expression that use
recursive definition. Let's extract out from the =compile-+=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (apply-recursively- op target operands)
  (let* ((last-operand? (no-operands? (rest-operands operands)))
         (next-target
          (if last-operand?
              target
              'arg2))
         (code-for-next-op
          (preserving
           '(arg2)
           (compile (first-operand operands)
                    'arg1 'next)
           (make-instruction-sequence
            '(arg1 arg2) (list next-target)
            `((assign ,next-target (op ,op) (reg arg1) (reg arg2)))))))
    (if last-operand?
        code-for-next-op
        (preserving
         '(env)
         code-for-next-op
         (apply-recursively- op target (rest-operands operands))))))
#+END_SRC

Then our original =compile-+= got
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-+ exp target linkage)
  (let ((operands (operands exp)))
    (let ((number-of-arguments (length operands)))
      (case number-of-arguments
        ((0)
         (end-with-linkage
          linkage
          (make-instruction-sequence
           '() (list target))
          `((assign ,target (const 0)))))
        ((1)
         (compile (first-operand operands)
                  target linkage))
        (else
         (let ((operands (reverse operands)))
           (end-with-linkage
            linkage
            (preserving
             '(env)
             (compile (first-operand operands)
                      'arg2 'next)
             (apply-recursively- '+ target (rest-operands operands))))))))))
#+END_SRC

The other is almost same as above:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; detector for *
(define (*? exp) (tagged-list? exp '*))

(define (compile-* exp target linkage)
  (let ((operands (operands exp)))
    (let ((number-of-arguments (length operands)))

** Lexical Addressing
*** Exercise 5.39
Here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (lexical-address-lookup address env)
  (let ((val
         (list-ref
          (frame-values
           (frame-ref env (frame-number address)))
          (displacement-number address))))
    (if (eq? val '*unassigned*)
        (error "Unassigned variable:"
               (list-ref
                (frame-variables
                 (frame-ref env (frame-number address)))
                (displacement-number address)))
        val)))

;; ADT for environment
(define (frame-ref env index) (list-ref env index))

;; ADT for lexical-address
(define (make-lexical-address frame-num displacement-num)
  `(,frame-num ,displacement-num))
(define (frame-number address) (car address))
(define (displacement-number address) (cadr address))
#+END_SRC

Test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; Test for lexical-address-lookup
(define test-environment
  (extend-environment

;; variable x

;Unassigned variable: a
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:

#+END_SRC

Then =lexical-address-set!= can be implemented similarly:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (lexical-address-set! address val env)
  (set-car!
   (list-tail
    (frame-values

*** Exercise 5.40
Here is the main code:

     (compile-sequence (lambda-body exp) 'val 'return env))))

Then we should modify current =compile= clauses to accept =env= as additional

*** Exercise 5.44
The reasoning behind what we trying to implement is follows: If the given open
coded primitive procedure found in the given compile time environment (with
=find-variable= procedure), then we should hand over given expression to the
=compile-application=; otherwise, it means either given procedure variable bound
in global environment which is dynamic one so we can not access that in compile
time or not bound at all (to be used compile time).

This analysis means the only case we can not cope with in this scheme is the one
defined in global environment by =define= or through =set!= what primitive
procedure bound in the global environment for the interpreter.

Well, enough for word; let's implement it:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (not-bound? var env)
  (eq? (find-variable var env) 'not-found))
#+END_SRC

And then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
,*** in compile clause
        ((and (not-bound? (operator exp) env)
              (+? exp))
         (compile-+ exp target linkage env))
        ((and (not-bound? (operator exp) env)
              (*? exp))
         (compile-* exp target linkage env))
        ((and (not-bound? (operator exp) env)
              (open-coded-prims? exp)) =>
         (lambda (op-binding)
           (compile-open-coded-prim exp target linkage env (cadr op-binding))))
        ((application? exp)
         (compile-application exp target linkage env))

Works well.
** Interfacing Compiled Code to the Evaluator
If we allowed to optimize our compiler using the preceding exercises, that is,
to use the opencoded primitive procedures and lexical operations, we can cause
even more dramatic result:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(compile-and-go
 '(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1)) n))))

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 17 maximum-depth = 9)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

#+END_SRC

Versus normal version of compiler:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(compile-and-go
 '(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1)) n))))

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 31 maximum-depth = 14)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 5.45
**** a.
We have already deduced the formulas for interpreted =factorial= and
special-purpose factorial machine; all the left is for the =factorial= using
=compile=. We'll do the analysis using two different versions of our compiler:
One for the unoptimized and the other for optimized using lexical operations and
open-coded primitives.

***** Via unoptimized compiler
Let's get the data to deduce the formulas for =total-pushes= and
=maximum-depth=. Actually as we know the resulting formula should be linear in
both, we can deduce wanting formula using only two data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 31 maximum-depth = 14)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 4)

(total-pushes = 25 maximum-depth = 11)
;;; EC-Eval value:
24

#+END_SRC

From this data, we can formulate as
- =total-pushes= = /6n + 1/
- =maximum-depth= = /3n - 1/


So the ratio for the =total-pushes= in compiled version to interpreted version
converges to 3/16; and that for =maximum-depth= is 3/5.

And that of compiled version to special-purpose factorial machine are 3 and 3/2,
respectively.
***** Via optimized compiler
If we do the same thing as we did preceding one, we got
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 17 maximum-depth = 9)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 4)

(total-pushes = 14 maximum-depth = 7)
;;; EC-Eval value:
24

#+END_SRC

Then,
- =total-pushes= = /3n + 2/
- =maximum-depth= = /2n - 1/


So the ratio for the =total-pushes= in this to interpreted version converges to
3/32; and that for =maximum-depth= is 2/5.

And that of this to special-purpose factorial machine are 3/2 and 1, respectively.
**** b.
For the unoptimized compiler, just use the optimized one; but if we aren't
satisfied with the difference the performance produced by optimized compiler
from special-purpose factorial machine, we should analyze the controller code to
realize what causes that difference:

Here is the generated code from optimized compiler:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(pp (compile
     '(define (factorial n)
        (if (= n 1)
            1
            (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
     'val 'next
     the-empty-compile-time-env))

((env)
 (val)
 ((assign val (op make-compiled-procedure) (label entry11) (reg env))
  (goto (label after-lambda10))
  entry11

If we compare this code with the =fact-machine= in [[Exercise 5.14][Exercise 5.14]], we come to
know that the only overhead of stack operation is =(save env)= as annotated
above code; we have introduced this overhead when we dealing with the lexical
address to lookup variable, if the given variable not found in the lexical
environment then it means it should be found in global environment; we've
exploited this fact into our compiler.

If we reverse this optimization we can remove this overhead stack operation, but
this only disguise the overhead into the operation =lookup-variable-value=,
which, in principle, should be implemented as subroutines; so basically we
couldn't resolved the optimization problem.

Nevertheless, let's verify our observation by reverting noted optimization:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-variable exp target linkage env)
  (let ((address (find-variable exp env)))
    (end-with-linkage
     linkage
     (if (eq? address 'not-found)
         (make-instruction-sequence
          ;; '() (list-union '(env) (list target))
          '(env) (list target)
          `(;; (assign env (op get-global-environment))
            (assign ,target
                    (op lookup-variable-value)
                    (const ,exp)
                    (reg env))))
         (make-instruction-sequence
          '(env) (list target)
          `((assign ,target
                    (op lexical-address-lookup)
                    (const ,address)
                    (reg env))))))))
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 13 maximum-depth = 8)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 4)

(total-pushes = 11 maximum-depth = 6)
;;; EC-Eval value:
24

#+END_SRC

As expected, now the asymptotic complexity of these stack operations got same as
the special-purpose factorial machine -- both ratio became just 1 together; but
as noted above this is not the real improvement -- just spurious appearance.

To make this produced code improved, not just spuriously, we need to get rid of
the =lookup-variable-value= operation which possibly be the main place of the
overhead if the global environment has a lot of bindings and so on.

So one strategy we can come up with is replace all the =lookup-variable-value=
with =lexical-address-lookup= since it exploit the compile time environment,
compiler can alleviate the work of machine should do in execution time a lot.

To do this, we need to change the definition of =factorial= using =named-let=
expression, which does not change the algorithm of the original =factorial= at
all. This would make close our machine's behavior that execute compiled code to
the special-purpose machine.
*** Exercise 5.46
We will do the same thing to procedure computing the Fibonacci numbers. As noted
in the text book, the analysis result for interpreted version obtained in
[[Exercise 5.29][Exercise 5.29]].

So here, we are going to analyze the special-purpose machine for Fibonacci and
compiled version (one for the unoptimized and the other for the optimized).

Before doing analysis, note that we know the complexity of steps and spaces
about the Fibonacci algorithm in asymptotic manner; this complexity doesn't
change by the implementation strategy. So we expect the complexity of space
should be linear and that of step should be exponential -- same as the Fibonacci
number.
**** Analyze special purpose machine
***** =Maximum-depth=
As it is linear, we can estimate the formula with just 2 data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(start fib-machine)
4

(total-pushes = 16 maximum-depth = 6)
;Value: done

(start fib-machine)
5

(total-pushes = 28 maximum-depth = 8)
;Value: done
#+END_SRC

From this fact, we know the =maximum-depth= be /2(n - 1)/.
***** =Total-pushes=
We can use the strategy of analysis of [[Exercise 5.29][exercise 5.29]]b since the complexity is
same. So if we apply that formulation to following data:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(start fib-machine)
0

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;Value: done

(start fib-machine)
1

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;Value: done

(start fib-machine)
2

(total-pushes = 4 maximum-depth = 2)
;Value: done

(start fib-machine)
3

(total-pushes = 8 maximum-depth = 4)
;Value: done
#+END_SRC

We got =total-pushes= = /4 (Fib(n + 1) - 1)/
**** Analyze machine operated on compiled code
***** Via unoptimized compiler
We will omit the description for below code since it is same process as above
and simply can be deduced by preceding context.

****** =Maximum-depth=
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

(total-pushes = 47 maximum-depth = 11)

(total-pushes = 19 maximum-depth = 5)
;;; EC-Eval value:
1

#+END_SRC

=Total-pushes= = /11 Fib(n + 1) - 3/
**** Summarizing statistics
So the ratios of unoptimized compiler version to the interpreted version are 3/5
and 5/28 respectively; and those of unoptimized compiler version to the
special-purpose machine version are 3/2 and 5/2 respectively.

With optimized one, the above ratios are 2/5 and 11/56 compared to interpreted
one, and 1 and 11/4 compared to special-purpose machine.

The reason the unoptimized version has less =total-pushes= than optimized one is
same [[Exercise 5.45][preceding exercise]]; and the improvement strategy also be same as that.

If we remove the assignment of =global-environment=, we got
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 0)

(total-pushes = 7 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
0

;;; EC-Eval input:

(total-pushes = 7 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
1

;;; EC-Eval input:
(fib 2)

(total-pushes = 14 maximum-depth = 4)
;;; EC-Eval value:
1

#+END_SRC

which implies =total-pushes= = /7 Fib(n + 1)/.

With this exercise, we could detect erroneous behavior of our optimized
compiler:

#+END_SRC

Please note the annotated instruction; it just duplicate preceding instruction.
This is due to the fact that we destroyed the barrier between what we assumed as
primitive procedures available as machine operations and not; more specifically
we mixed the static operation and dynamic operation which leads to leak the guts
-- =(assign env (op get-global-environment))= -- of what we assumed available as
machine operation.

So for now, let us fix this problem using ad-hoc procedure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (lookup-variable-value-in-frame var env frame-num)
  (lookup-variable-value
   var
   (extend-env-with-frame (frame-ref env frame-num)
                          the-empty-environment)))

(define (extend-env-with-frame frame env) (cons frame env))
#+END_SRC

Then:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-variable exp target linkage env)
  (let ((address (find-variable exp env)))
    (end-with-linkage
     linkage
     (if (eq? address 'not-found)
         (make-instruction-sequence
          '(env) (list target)
          `((assign ,target
                    (op lookup-variable-value-in-frame)
                    (const ,exp)
                    (reg env)
                    (const ,(length env))))) ;relative frame number for global env
         (make-instruction-sequence
          '(env) (list target)
          `((assign ,target

#+END_SRC

Now we resolved the duplicative code:

*** Exercise 5.47
This exercise is a lot like the analogous process of extension of evaluator to
use the compiled procedure.

From the contraction of =compound-apply= subroutine, all we need to do is to
save the return point into the stack. The rest is obvious. Here is the resulting
code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-procedure-call target linkage)
  (let ((primitive-branch (make-label 'primitive-branch))

          (branch (label ,primitive-branch))))
       (make-instruction-sequence
        '(proc) '()
        `((test (op compound-procedure?) (reg proc))
          (branch (label ,compound-branch))))
       (parallel-instruction-sequences

       after-call))))
#+END_SRC

Then =compound-proc-appl= becomes
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compound-proc-appl target linkage)

         (make-instruction-sequence

         (error "return linkage, target not val -- COMPILE"
                target))))
#+END_SRC

To accommodate arbitrary arguments for =parallel-instruction-sequence= like
above, we need to change that procedure analogous to
=append-instruction-sequence=:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (parallel-instruction-sequences . seqs)
  (define (parallel-2-sequences seq1 seq2)
    (make-instruction-sequence
     (list-union (registers-needed seq1)

     (list-union (registers-modified seq1)
                 (registers-modified seq2))
     (append (statements seq1) (statements seq2))))
  (define (parallel-seq-list seqs)
    (if (null? seqs)
        (empty-instruction-sequence)
        (parallel-2-sequences (car seqs)
                              (parallel-seq-list (cdr seqs)))))
  (parallel-seq-list seqs))
#+END_SRC

Now let's test:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(compile-and-go

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:

#+END_SRC

Works as expected!
*** Exercise 5.48
To implement given task, we should realize that the assembled instructions, the
instruction procedures, are just mutating the machine's state -- the contents of
registers, the contents of stack, (implicitly) the contents of heap. So by
defining the =compile-and-run= procedure as primitive in global environment, we
can actually access the machine state with =eceval= since at that point,
=eceval= defined underlying Scheme's global environment.

As it is similar procedure with =compile-and-go= in that behavior, we can learn
from that procedure to get idea what we have to do to implement
=compile-and-run=.

As noted above, we can use the current state of machine, and our
=compile-and-run= procedure executed with =pritivie-apply= subroutine, we should
organize that combination to the analogous expression of =external-entry= except
for the initializing process as we are going to use current state.

That is, we need to arrange =compile-and-run= to get =continue= register have
the return point before =goto= the newly compiled instructions.

As =apply-primitive-procedure= does not change the contents of =continue=, we
can change the order as follows safely:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
primitive-apply
  (restore continue)                    ;changed
  (assign val (op apply-primitive-procedure)
              (reg proc)
              (reg argl))
  (goto (reg continue))
#+END_SRC

Then now =compile-and-run= called with =continue= register having return point,
all the left is =goto= the newly compiled code, which produced from the given
expression. As we can treat =eceval= machine as if we were in the outside of
that machine, we can mimic the behavior of =goto= rather direct fashion:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-and-run user-exp)
  ;; provided that continue register contains return point
  (let* ((exp (pair*->pair user-exp))
         (instructions
          (assemble
           (statements
            (compile exp 'val 'return the-empty-compile-time-env))
           eceval)))
    (set-register-contents! eceval 'pc instructions)))
#+END_SRC

(Here we used =pair*->pair= since the pair object constructed by user is
different from the underlying pair object to protect the tagged data.)

Then let's test this:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(compile-and-run
 '(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1)) n))))

(total-pushes = 5 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
factorial

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
done

#+END_SRC

Unfortunately this won't work; if we trace the execution, we realize that our
evaluator start to execute from the second instruction of what compiled, not
first.

To verify this observation, let's modify above defintion as follows
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-and-run user-exp)
  ;; provided that continue register contains return point
  (let* ((exp (pair*->pair user-exp))
         (instructions
          (assemble
           (statements
            (compile exp 'val 'return the-empty-compile-time-env))
           eceval)))
    (set-register-contents! eceval 'pc (cons 'dummy instructions))))
#+END_SRC

Then we get
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(compile-and-run
 '(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1)) n))))

(total-pushes = 5 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
factorial

(total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
;;; EC-Eval value:
<compiled-procedure>

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 13 maximum-depth = 8)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

#+END_SRC

But this strategy destroy the ADT of machine; we would be better to treat
=compile-and-run= explicitly like =compile-and-go=; but it would cause overhead
to apply primitivie procedures since now it should ensure the flag =false=
before applying the primitive procedure.

It was not a big deal when it comes to the =compile-and-go= since we =start=
machine just once to start up the REPL.

Whatever, let's just try this idea:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
primitive-apply
  (restore continue)
  (assign flag (op get-false))          ;initialize the flag
  (assign val (op apply-primitive-procedure)
              (reg proc)
              (reg argl))
  (branch (label temporary-external-entry))
  (goto (reg continue))

temporary-external-entry
  (goto (reg val))
#+END_SRC

With

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (compile-and-run user-exp)
  ;; provided that continue register contains return point
  (let* ((exp (pair*->pair user-exp))
         (instructions
          (assemble
           (statements
            (compile exp 'val 'return the-empty-compile-time-env))
           eceval)))
    (set-register-contents! eceval 'flag true)
    instructions))
#+END_SRC

And in the =eceval-operations=
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
   ;; alternative implementation for exercise 5.48
   `(get-false ,(lambda () false))
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(compile-and-run
 '(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1)) n))))

(total-pushes = 5 maximum-depth = 3)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(factorial 5)

(total-pushes = 13 maximum-depth = 8)
;;; EC-Eval value:
120

#+END_SRC

Works as expected.

Or without using =get-false=, we could exploit following fact
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(false? (car '(#f)))

;Value: #t
#+END_SRC

Then
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
primitive-apply
  (restore continue)
  (assign flag (const #f))          ;initialize the flag
  (assign val (op apply-primitive-procedure)
              (reg proc)
              (reg argl))
  (branch (label temporary-external-entry))
  (goto (reg continue))
#+END_SRC

Well, this alternative implementation is better in that it does not exploit the
implementation detail; thus do not cut through the abstraction barrier.

I think the most reasonable solution would be changing the specifications of the
machine as to use =next-pc= explicitly rather than =cdr= the current =pc=. If we
chose that specification, then our original implementation of =compile-and-run=
can do their job without breaking the specification by setting the =next-pc= to
the newly compiled instruction.

#+END_SRC
*** Exercise 5.50
The whole idea is straightforward one, as noted in the statement, making all the
details to work needs extra works. That is, we need to unwind all the higher
order procedures -- e.g. =map= -- or the primitive procedures that should be
provided underlying Scheme language -- e.g. =apply-in-underlying-scheme=.

Here is the complement code:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; IN MCEVAL

(define (caddr exp) (car (cddr exp)))

(define (caadr exp) (car (cadr exp)))
(define (cadadr exp) (cadr (cadr exp)))

;;; Rewind all the higher order function

(compile-and-go
 '(begin
    ;;;;METACIRCULAR EVALUATOR FROM CHAPTER 4 (SECTIONS 4.1.1-4.1.4) of

(total-pushes = 9 maximum-depth = 5)
;;; EC-Eval value:
metacircular-evaluator-loaded

;;; EC-Eval input:
(define the-global-environment (setup-environment))
;The object "Too few arguments supplied", passed as the first argument to car, is not the correct type.
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 2) => Specify an argument to use in its place.
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

..Oops! Debugging time! Turns out we mistyped the =map= procedure. If we fix
that as follows
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (map proc lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car lst))
            (map proc (cdr lst)))))
#+END_SRC

It works as expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; EC-Eval input:
(define the-global-environment (setup-environment))

(total-pushes = 243 maximum-depth = 24)
;;; EC-Eval value:
ok

;;; EC-Eval input:
(driver-loop)


;;; M-Eval input:
#+END_SRC

Let's test the behavior:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; M-Eval input:
(car '(1 2))
;Unknown expression type -- EVAL (car (quote (1 2)))
;To continue, call RESTART with an option number:
; (RESTART 1) => Return to read-eval-print level 1.
#+END_SRC

Oops! This is due to the our =read= er spitting out unwrapped =pair= object --
not the user =pair= object:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; IN ECEVAL-SUPPORT
(define read*
  (check-error-with
   (named-lambda (read)
     (pair->pair* (read)))
   0))

;; in primitive-procedures
        `(read ,read*)
#+END_SRC

Let's retry
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; M-Eval input:
(define x (cons 2 3))

;;; M-Eval value:
ok

;;; M-Eval input:
x

;;; M-Eval value:
(2 . 3)

#+END_SRC

It seems like working as expected except
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; M-Eval input:
(car (cons 2 3))

;;; M-Eval value:
(error (The object  (2 . 3)  is not a pair -- car))

#+END_SRC

... Need to debug! By reasoning, we should realize this is due to our
inconsiderate =apply*= definition; we shouldn't unwrap the ADT of user pair --
our primitive operations expect the argument to be wrapped.

So, actually we should have defined =apply*= as
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define apply*
  (check-error-with
   (named-lambda (apply proc* args*)
     (apply (primitive-implementation proc*) (map pair->pair* (pair*->pair args*))))
   2))
#+END_SRC

Now it works as expected:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; M-Eval input:
(cons 2 3)

;;; M-Eval value:
(2 . 3)

;;; M-Eval input:
(car (cons 2 3))

;;; M-Eval value:
2

;;; M-Eval input:
(null? '())

;;; M-Eval value:
#t

#+END_SRC

**** Conclusion
We have dealt quite complex expressions since we protected the data structures
we made to represent components composing our underlying environment (by making
=pair= object). As this process erected several "Scheme" languages -- universal
register machine, which also used to execute compiled code, that evaluate Scheme
expression erected on underlying Scheme, and in that universal machine, we
execute the code resulted from compiling the meta circular evaluator Scheme program.

Whew! It was quite complicated process to make it work than I ever thought!
