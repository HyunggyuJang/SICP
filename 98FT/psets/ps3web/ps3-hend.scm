; point-between-lines?
;
; Determines if a point lies between two *parallel* lines. The
; parallel lines are each represented by an origin vector, and a
; direction vector relative to that origin.  Since the lines are
; parallel, only one direction vector is needed.
;
; Implementation.
; We need:
;  - a normal vector to the two lines
;  - a vector t1 from any point on line1 (e.g. from origin1) to point
;  - a vector t2 from any point on line2 (e.g. from origin2) to point
;
; Then the dot-product of normal and t1 will be of the opposite sign
; to the dot-product of normal and t2 if the point lies between the
; two lines.  If the point lines on either line, then its dot product
; will be zero, so we can condense the check to looking at the sign
; of the product of the two dot-products.
