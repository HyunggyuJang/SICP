;; Exercise 2.3
;; representation for rectangle in plane

;; NOTE: The use case, in which we calculate the perimeter and area of given rectangle,
;; just need the two adjacent side's length.

;; Let's experiment with representation
;; make-rectangular
;; fully determined by base-point, width, height.
;; We ignore the tilted rectangles; i.e. width is the x-axis side length,
;; height is the y-axis side length.
(define (make-rec base-point width height)
  (cons base-point
        (cons width
              height)))
;; according to the constructor, we abstract the selector as follows:
;; selectors: base-point, width, height
(define (base-point rec)
  (car rec))
(define (width rec)
  (car (cdr rec)))
(define (height rec)
  (cdr (cdr rec)))
;; calculate perimeter of rectangle
(define (perimeter rec)
  (* 2 (+ (width rec)
          (height rec))))
;; calculate area of rectangle
(define (area rec)
  (* (width rec)
     (height rec)))

;; Or we could implement the rectangle with left bottom point and right top point.
(define (make-rec left-bottom right-top)
  (cons left-bottom right-top))
;; Also we assume that the sides are parallel with x,y axis respectively.
;; With above assumption, it is useful to define selectors as previous;
;; base-point is the left bottom point, width is x-axis side length,
;; height is y-axis side length.
(define (base-point rec)
  (car rec))
(define (width rec)
  (let ((left-bottom (car rec))
        (right-top (cdr rec)))
    (- (x-point right-top)
       (x-point left-bottom))))
(define (height rec)
  (let ((left-bottom (car rec))
        (right-top (cdr rec)))
    (- (y-point right-top)
       (y-point left-bottom))))
;; Then the perimeter and area are same as above.
